</div>

<p>Of the author of this volume it was said by
President Hill at the 1906 A. L. A. Conference,
“he has given the subject of Library Architecture
more thought and attention, probably,
than any other member.”</p>

<p>Mr. Soule is well known to older librarians.
To introduce him to a younger generation and
to architects, we would say that although he is
a publisher and bookseller, and not professionally
a librarian, he has had an effective training in
library science. He joined the American Library
Association in 1879, became at once a working
member, has attended twenty Conferences, and
has been elected to office, as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>1888-1899—Trustee of the Brookline (Mass.) Public Library.</li>
<li>1890-1908—Publishing Board, A. L. A.</li>
<li>1890—Vice-president.</li>
<li>1893-1896, 1900-1905—Member of the Council.</li>
<li>1894-1906—Trustee Endowment Fund.</li>
<li>1906-1912—Member of the Institute.</li>
</ul>

<p>In 1890, when a prominent trustee had been
quoted as saying, “it was no use consulting
librarians about building, for no two of them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_viii"></a>[viii]</span>
agree on any one point,” he wrote, and the 1890
Conference unanimously adopted, “Points of
Agreement among Librarians on Library Architecture.”</p>

<p>In 1892 he published in the Boston press an
exhaustive series of nine letters, taking the side
of the librarians of the country against what
they thought to be radical errors in the management
and building of the Boston Public Library.</p>

<p>In 1901 he wrote the article “Library,” for
Sturgis’s Dictionary of Architecture.</p>

<p>In 1902 he wrote the A. L. A. tract on
“Library Rooms and Buildings.”</p>

<p>For forty active years in business as a bookseller,
he has handled and issued books.</p>

<p>For over thirty years of membership in the
A. L. A. he has been intimate with leading
librarians.</p>

<p>In the Boston controversy, he felt obliged
to investigate thoroughly every point he criticized
on behalf of the librarians.</p>

<p>When elected as a trustee in Brookline he
found a very conservative board at the time the
new developments of library progress were
slowly gaining ground, and had to go to the bottom
of every new method before the board
could be persuaded to try it.</p>

<p>During the last five years Mr. Soule has frequently
been called on as an expert, and has
been through all the detail of building problems
of several different grades.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_ix"></a>[ix]</span></p>

<p>All this educated him in such a school of experience
that Mr. Dewey thus spoke of him at
one of the A. L. A. Conferences: “When people
ask who are the most active and efficient librarians
in America we are almost sure to name two
or three men who are not librarians at all; for
instance, R. R. Bowker and C. C. Soule.”</p>

<p>After such experience, we can commend what
the author has to say, to respectful attention.</p>

<p>Illustrations have been suggested, but have
not been included in this volume lest they should
increase the bulk and price too much. If they
are asked for, we will issue a separate volume
of illustrative plates.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">AUTHOR’S PREFACE</h2>

</div>

<p>On being asked to write on “Library Architecture”
for this series I hesitated, knowing
little about the subject except as applied to the
insides of libraries. But on this limited branch
I have had some experience which I am willing
to embody under the narrower title finally
chosen, for the benefit of librarians, architects,
and building committees. I even venture to
hope some chapters may get to the notice of
trustees, donors, and other citizens interested
in libraries.</p>

<p>The themes of this volume are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Preëminence of utility over display.</li>
<li>The practical nature of library work.</li>
<li>The importance and variety of its details.</li>
<li>Their differentiation from other kinds of work.</li>
<li>The vital need of consulting library experts.</li>
</ul>

<p>The treatment adopted is, to cover every
point and touch on every detail involved in
building a large library of any class. I hope
that readers interested in lesser libraries, even
those of small grades, may be able to pick out
hints to help them, or at least to look ahead
to growth and larger problems yet to come.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xii"></a>[xii]</span></p>

<p>I have not undertaken to discuss methods of
library work, and only allude to them so far
as they affect construction. Nor have I undertaken
to recommend specific makes of furniture
or fittings, although I have felt free in a
few instances to suggest principles which should
govern selection.</p>

<p>I have not trusted entirely to experience or to
advice received from librarians and architects;
but wishing to treat thoroughly so momentous
a subject, I have spent six months in search
through all authorities in England as well as
in America, including back volumes of the library
periodicals. I did not expect to get much
help from England, where methods differ from
ours, but I find the transatlantic writers are
so thoroughly in accord with us as to the need
of expert advice in planning, that I have cited
their views copiously.</p>

<p>To all these sources, and to countless friends,
I am so indebted for suggestions and advice
that I look on myself as an editor of professional
opinion, rather than as an original author.
But I assume responsibility, while rendering
sincere thanks to all authorities quoted or unquoted.</p>

<p>Within the limit of one volume it has been
possible only to sketch principles without describing
details under every subject as in a
manual. I have been asked to illustrate this
volume with views and plans, but the publishers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiii"></a>[xiii]</span>
find that this would double its size and price.
They have therefore decided to wait and test
the actual demand by inquiry. If enough purchasers
wish a second volume, one will be issued.</p>

<p>For my general principles I expect endorsement
from all librarians. As to details, I do
not ask so much for endorsement as for criticism—not
mere fault-finding, but helpful constructive
criticism, pointing out something better
than is herein advocated. If interest and
discussion are stimulated, and library science
is thereby in any degree advanced, I shall feel
that my work has not been wasted.</p>

<h3 id="subhead-1">EVOLUTION OF LIBRARY BUILDING</h3>

<p>[For the first chapters of this book, I am largely indebted
to an interesting and scholarly volume by John
Willis Clark, entitled “The Care of Books,” published
in the year 1901 at Cambridge, Eng. I am emboldened
to quote from it by noting how much later books and
cyclopedias rely on it as their chief authority, and I commend
to all readers both text and illustrations of this
fascinating work.]</p>

<h3 id="subhead-2">The Dawn of History</h3>

<p>No precedents of buildings or fixtures loom out of the
farthest past. Archæological excavations have found
relics of libraries in early ruins, libraries of baked clay
tablets, evidently once housed in separate rooms on
upper stories of palaces or temples. This literature
must have seemed imperishable. There were no fading
inks, no crumbling paper, no danger from moisture
or worms. But an older foe, still threatening libraries,
lurked in that brick era of literature. Fire, both worshiped
and feared, was finally fatal. Fire following
conquest attacked the oldest libraries and dropped them
in shattered fragments into prehistoric cellars, to lie
for centuries awaiting exhumation. But even as now
resurrected, they tell no tales of their housing or shelving
or circulation. It would seem hopeless to grope among
these shards for lessons in library science. And yet
Dr. Richard Garnett<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> deduced from an Assyrian hexagonal
book tablet the idea of hexagonal bookcases for
the British Museum.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span></p>

<h3 id="subhead-3">Ancient History</h3>

<p>In the early days of Egypt, Greece, and Rome, libraries
of papyrus and parchment rolls, stored on shelves,
in pigeon-holes and in chests, were collected, at first by
sovereigns, then by nobles, then by scholars. For centuries
they occupied rooms in palaces and in temples.
These rooms were only places of storage. Other rooms,
or oftener colonnades, served for reading. The distinction
between book rooms and reading rooms thus
appeared at an early date.</p>

<p>The first mention of a separate library building is
made in Egypt in the time of Ptolemy Philadelphus, the
third century B.C. Two centuries before, Pisistratus,
in Greece, had established a public library, whether or
no in a house of its own is not noted. About 40 B.C.,
Asinius Pollio seems to have built the first library building
in Rome. Augustus soon built two more, and thereafter
public libraries and private library rooms abounded.
In the fourth century A.D. there were twenty-eight
“public libraries” in Rome. Although these were undoubtedly,
while “public,” used mainly by scholars,
having few of the functions which so highly diversify
and differentiate modern public libraries, their buildings
must have begun to assume some common arrangement
which would tend to constitute a type. I am unable
to reproduce, however, any clear picture of the architecture
of these first buildings.</p>

<p>As to fixtures, Mr. Clark sums up a chapter:<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> “Unfortunately
no enthusiast of those distant times has
handed down to us a complete description of his library,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
and we are obliged to take a detail from one account,
and a detail from another, and so piece the picture
together for ourselves. What I may call the pigeonhole
system, suitable for rolls only, was replaced by
presses which could contain rolls if required, but were
especially designed for codices (the first phase of parchment,
in the modern book form). These presses were
sometimes plain, sometimes richly ornamented. The
floor, the walls, the roof were also decorated. As the
books were hidden in the presses, the library note was
struck by numerous inscriptions, and by busts and portraits
of authors.”</p>

<p>This Roman conception of a library prevailed during
the dark ages and has survived to our own time in its
most sumptuous form, embodied in the Vatican library,
whose interior has so often been represented in photographs
and engravings.</p>

<p>With the close of the western empire, in <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 476, the
ancient era of libraries may be said also to close without
any lessons to us as to building.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span></p>

<h3 id="subhead-4">Mediæval History</h3>

<p>Thus far libraries were gathered and cared for by
monarchs, princes, or prominent citizens. With the
growth of Christianity literature fell to the care of the
ecclesiastics. Their earliest collection, of which record
remains, was shelved in the apse of a church. About
<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 300, monastic communities began to cherish church
literature. Existing records all indicate that cloisters
were the first Christian libraries, perhaps because all
the monks could assemble there. What few precious
manuscript volumes the laborious brothers had fashioned,
with others given or bought, were stored on shelves or in
“presses” on the inner walls. The readers either took
the books to their cells, or read them by the light of the
windows in the outer wall. There were the reading
room, the book room, and the lending room, all in one
long, well-lighted cloister. Later, as more manuscripts
accumulated, they were stored at first in niches in the
wall, then in adjacent closets or small windowless rooms.
Readers still studied by the best light. To follow Clark’s
quotation:<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> “On the north syde of the Cloister (at Durham)
in every window were ... Pews or Carrels where
every Monk studyed upon his books. And in every
Carrel was a deske to lye their bookes on.”</p>

<p>Elsewhere it is explained that each window was in
three parts, with a carrel from one stanchell of the
window to another.</p>

<p>This use of windows suggested to me a new convenience
for research in our modern “stack,” which is
described in a later chapter as the “stack carrel.”<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span></p>

<p>The growth of libraries slowly followed the development
of monastic orders. The systematic care and use
of books began with the precepts of S. Benedict in the
sixth century, followed by similar rules in other brotherhoods.
At the same time secular libraries and library
buildings were devastated by the barbarians, while the
Arabs, who developed large libraries, appeared to have
housed them in mosques, so that library building science
slumbered through the Dark Ages.</p>

<p>In the sixth and seventh centuries learning followed
the first steps of Christianity into the British Isles.
The earliest English “library movement” began in the
monasteries of Ireland and Great Britain.</p>

<p>From that era onward, libraries all over Christianized
Europe grew with the prosperity of religious brotherhoods.
Of progress toward building, however, there is
little record until the Cistercians moved theirs from the
cloisters to other rooms in their monasteries, although
some use of cloisters elsewhere lingered until the beginning
of the seventeenth century. These rooms were at
first directly over the cloisters, where alcoves first appeared,
on the window side only. Still later libraries
were assigned to the upper stories of separate buildings,
the first put to this use since the time of the Cæsars
in Rome.</p>

<p>These first mediæval libraries, of which several pictures
are preserved, send to us the precedent of ample
and aptly applied daylight admitted through long windows
directly into each alcove. The exteriors remind
us of our stack rooms. This arrangement of library
rooms passed by imitation in the fourteenth and fifteenth
centuries from the monasteries to the colleges, and still
survives in the older libraries of Oxford and Cambridge,—for
instance, Merton College, a long, narrow room with
bookcases between the windows, at right angles with
the walls, forming well-lighted alcoves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span></p>

<p>All of the earliest library rooms were long and narrow.
Clark has preserved the measurements of several thus:—</p>

<p>A.D. 1289. Zutphen (Holland): A solid building
separated from others (in case of fire): 120 feet long,
36 feet broad: 19 uniform windows east and west,
“that plenty of daylight might fall upon the desks and
fill the whole length and breadth of the library.”</p>

<p>A.D. 1422. The Franciscan House in London,
“Christ’s Hospital” (the first building in England built
expressly for a library?) founded by Sir Richard Whittington;
129 feet long by 31 feet broad, with 28 desks
and 28 double settles.</p>

<p>A.D. 1508. At Canterbury: the library over the
Prior’s Chapel was 60 feet long by 20 feet broad, and
had 16 bookcases, each 4 shelves high.</p>

<p>A.D. 1517. At Clairvaux: in the cloister are 14
studies, where the monks write and study, and over it
the new library, 180 feet long by 17 wide (probably
this narrowness followed the shape of the cloister) with
48 benches, “excellently lighted on both sides by large
windows.”</p>

<p>It will be noted that these bookshelves were about
four feet “on centers,” and that great emphasis was laid
on ample daylight.</p>

<p>From the thirteenth century comes this warning for
us—“the press in which books are kept ought to be
lined inside with wood that the damp of the walls may
not moisten or stain them,” which is singularly like a
caution in a recent American manual against leaving
unpainted brick walls at the back of wall cases.</p>

<p>It seems singular that wall shelving, which was certainly
used in Assyrian libraries and in the classical
period, disappears in the monkish era and yields to
“presses” or closed bookcases; to appear as a new device
in the library of the Escorial in Spain in the year 1583.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
Sir Christopher Wren thought so much of this feature
that he followed it in Trinity College (Cambridge)
library in 1695, saying, “The disposition of the shelves
both along the walls and breaking out from the walls
must prove very convenient and gracefull: A little
square table in each cell with two seats.”</p>

<p>The fifteenth century had been a library era throughout.
In the sixteenth came the Reformation, which
swept away “papistical” libraries. More than eight
hundred libraries of monastic orders, in England alone,
were dispersed or destroyed by this iconoclastic whirlwind.
In 1540 the only libraries left were at Oxford
and Cambridge and in the cathedrals. But at the
same time, the invention and rapid spread of printing
had superseded the slow processes of making manuscript
books, and had opened a new life for libraries.
The first library built under these new conditions was
that of St. John’s College, which brought over from the
monastic and early college era the alcove arrangement.</p>

<p>The renaissance of wall shelving spread rapidly.
Compared with the chaining of books to the shelves,
which it superseded, it was an open-access reform.
To quote Cardinal Mazarin’s library motto, “Publice
patere voluit.” It was quickly followed in France,
but more slowly in England. In 1610 this form of
shelving with a gallery was adopted in the Bodleian
Library at Oxford (see illustration on p. 275 of Clark),
the progenitor of our first distinctive American library
interiors, now discredited and almost abandoned.</p>

<h3 id="subhead-5">Modern History</h3>

<p>From the beginning of the seventeenth to the middle
of the nineteenth century, there is little to chronicle in
the evolution of the library building. What libraries
were built or altered followed either the monastic-collegiate
alcove style, or the Escorial-Trinity wall
shelving and gallery, or both. The best illustrations of
libraries of this era are still extant at Oxford and Cambridge.
A view of what he calls the oldest example of the
combination of high wall shelving broken by a gallery,
with the older fashion of alcoves, as they still exist at
the Bodleian Library at Oxford, is shown by Duff-Brown
on p. 2. A fine specimen may be seen at Trinity
College, Dublin, interesting because of two modern
attempts to burst the confines of old walls: first, as shown
in the traces of sliding cases long antedating those of
the British Museum; second, in the two-story wooden
stack recently installed and already outgrown, in the
cloisters below the library, which were originally open
but were glassed in to protect the stack. (See illustrations,
reproducing photographs taken by the author.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>)</p>

<p>The first appearance of the floor case, the precedent
of the modern stack, appears in the library of the University
of Leyden in 1610, of which a large illustration
is given by Clark<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and a smaller one by Fletcher.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Here
is seen the utilization of the whole floor of a book room
through parallel cases evidently open to access, although
the books are all chained. The library is lofty and the
shelves lighted not directly from stack-windows, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
by chapel windows high in the wall, which appear to
fill the room with ample diffused light. Some of the
“broad-brims” pacing the floor may have been our
Pilgrim ancestors, who, for the ten years subsequent to the
date of this picture, were living at Leyden and frequenting
the University.</p>

<p>The Radcliffe Library at Oxford, designed in 1740,
seems to be the earliest example in England of a circular
reading room lighted from the roof. This is said
to have been suggested by the central reading room of
the old Wolfenbüttel Library, built about 1710.</p>

<p>“The first architect,” says Duff-Brown<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> “to plan a
library which in any way meets the modern requirements
of giving ample accommodation was Leopoldo
della Santa, who in 1816 published in Florence a
quarto pamphlet, which is an attempt to construct a
library building entirely from an utilitarian point of
view.” The plan, which Brown reproduces, suggests
Dr. Poole’s plan which was embodied in the Newberry
Library of Chicago.</p>

<p>In 1835 Delassert proposed for the French National
Library a circular plan of building, which perhaps
suggested the present reading room of the British
Museum. In 1885 Magnusson proposed an unending
whorl as a good form for a growing library.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>While English libraries, and those of the continent,
were developing these phases of old types, separate
library buildings began to appear in America. The
first one actually erected for library occupation still
remains in use,—the Redwood Library of Newport, R. I.,
built in 1750. The main room is a hall 37 × 26 feet,
19 feet high, with two lean-to rooms at the sides. A
massive portico gives an impressive front, but cannot
be said to found a distinctive library style.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span></p>

<p>Our early proprietary associations and parochial libraries
were stored in public buildings, or in buildings with
no peculiar features. The school district libraries established
by the state of New York in 1835, and similar
libraries founded soon after in other states, seem to have
been stored in schoolhouses, though intended for public
use. The state libraries, first established as early as
1773, were deposited in the State Houses. The Young
Men’s libraries of the early period were kept in rented
rooms, or at best in rented houses. No special phase
of library buildings was developed until about the
middle of the nineteenth century, when colleges began
to build. Gore Hall at Harvard (1841) was modeled
after King’s College Chapel at Cambridge, Eng., and
was even at that date said to be “ill adapted to the
purposes of a library.” The University of North Carolina
“erected” in 1850 a library in the form of a Greek
temple, with hall 84 × 32 feet, 20 feet high. These
essays at importing styles certainly developed no
models worth imitation, but nevertheless they were
imitated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span></p>

<h3 id="subhead-6">Our Own Era</h3>

<p>Our own “library age” may be said to date from the
middle of the nineteenth century. The parliamentary
investigations which led to the first English library act
in 1850, and the organization of the Boston Public
Library with us in 1852, mark the beginning of the modern
library movement. I will not try to trace the gradual
evolution of library buildings abroad. I do not know
enough about it to handle the subject well. I find,
however, in Edwards’ Free Town Libraries,<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> London,
1869, a prototype of our own “Points of Agreement
among Librarians on Library Architecture.” But as
late as 1907 an English architect (Champneys<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>) says
that “the examples of what a library building should
not be are out of all proportion to those which are
worthy to be followed.”</p>

<p>In America, building developed with the library
movement, at first getting rather ahead of it. Indeed,
there were few experienced librarians to direct it, and
even these were mainly the old style conservators and
bibliographers. The topic of building does not appear
in the discussions of the library conference in 1853.
The architects had to develop a precedent. The first
distinctive type to appear was adopted in the Astor
Library in New York (1853) and followed in the Boston
Public Library dedicated in 1858. The exterior of the
building had no peculiar features, but the interior was
distinctly a type to be outgrown. The main room was
a lofty hall, surrounded by galleried alcoves reaching
to the ceiling, storing the books, while the readers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
occupied the floor, into the middle of which the main
stairway arose among the tables. This impressive but
wasteful interior was copied in large cities throughout
the country, and was referred to in contemporaneous discussion
as the “conventional style.” As it was tested in
operation, and as its defects both for storage and administration
became evident, the library profession, then
getting together, unanimously condemned it. At the
Cincinnati Conference of 1882, the A. L. A. resolved
that “the time has come for a radical modification of
the prevailing style of library building, and the adoption
of a style better suited to economy and practical
utility.”<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> At first there was no agreement on a successor.
Richardson, the great architect, developed a
library type which was severely criticized by librarians.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
But in the rapid growth of libraries, the problem of close,
economical and accessible storage of books became acute.
How could these accumulating masses be stored and at
the same time used? The solution came in the “stack,”
at first fiercely fought by conservative librarians, but
now so universally accepted as to form the distinctive
feature of modern American library architecture.</p>

<p>In 1876 an impetus was given to library science, including
building, by the government report of that year
on libraries, and also by the formation of the American
Library Association. The annual meetings of the Association,
its discussions, the studies and reports of its
committees, the formation and activity of state, city,
and other local library associations, the establishment
of library schools, have all tended to build up a consensus
of opinion on important topics which has been recorded
in the library journals, and has slowly but surely impressed
itself on architects, on the public, and, not least
of all, upon building committees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span></p>

<p>A special impetus toward union among librarians was
the controversy which arose over the building of the
second Boston Public Library. The importation of its
exterior design from Paris, and the attempt to build up
an interior for it without any consultation with librarians
either local or national, seemed such a marked
snub to the profession just becoming conscious of power
and unity, that it aroused renewed attention to the
proper planning of library buildings. A trustee of the
library having stated in public that “it was no use to
consult librarians, for no two of them agreed on any
point,” the American Library Association endorsed unanimously
at its next conference the paper on “Points of
Agreement on Library Architecture,” which has since
been the accepted basis of all satisfactory plans. A
series of nine letters to the Boston <i>Herald</i>, criticizing
the building and the library management (republished
in 17 L. J.), vindicated the library side of the controversy
and brought about a change of management. And
yet this façade of the library Ste. Geneviève in Paris
has been repeated “with monotonous poverty of invention,”
says an architect, in the mistaken belief that a
building once labeled a library is a praiseworthy model
to be copied.</p>

<p>Another spur to library building during these last
years has been the Carnegie gifts. Their number and
wide range, furnishing at the same time an incentive
and a climax to both private beneficence and public
liberality, finally convinced architects that in library
buildings of all sizes and various purposes they had a
theme worthy of their best work and highest genius.
Mr. Carnegie’s first Public Free Library was founded in
1889, less than quarter of a century ago. Up to March,
1911, he had given funds for 2062 public and 115 college
libraries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span></p>

<h3 id="subhead-7">Forecasting the Years</h3>

<p>This rapid sketch has gleaned the records to show
how the housing of libraries has grown through centuries
toward a rapid development in our own age.</p>

<p id="subhead-8"><b>The Present.</b> In looking back through the last sixty
years, indeed through the last quarter-century, we contrast
twenty-five years ago with the present time. We
cannot fail to be satisfied with the advance in rational
building. We know better what we want; we are called
more into consultation with our trustees as to what is
wanted; our opinions are listened to with respect by
the architects. If every building is not as perfect as
we could wish, how much larger is the proportion of
serviceable libraries; how much smaller is the number
of stately failures? Turn over the plans in Koch’s
portfolio of Carnegie Libraries. See how much better
is the average interior, how much more satisfactory the
fenestration and proportions of the average exterior.
In the “Points of Agreement among Librarians,” adopted
as our chart in 1891, it was stated that “very few
library buildings erected during the previous ten years
conformed to all, and some of them conformed to none,
of these axiomatic requirements.” Could we not say
now that nearly all library buildings erected since 1891
conformed to most and many to all of what have
seemed to us the requisites of construction?</p>

<p id="subhead-9"><b>The Next Quarter Century.</b> What has the future
in store for us?</p>

<p>In the first place, a swarm of buildings. Private
beneficence, already aroused and stimulated, will continue
for at least another generation even after Carnegie<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
shall pass on to his reward. Public opinion in a
large part of our country has come to believe in the
library as it believes in the schools. Small libraries will
follow railway stations into all growing and ambitious
towns. Communities now inert will awake and, as
instruments for good, demand libraries to stand beside
their churches. The buildings of today will soon burst
their bounds in the flood of library progress, and require
enlargement or replacement.</p>

<p>The colleges will more and more recognize the relations
of libraries to instruction and the relations of the
building to the library. Large cities will experiment
with large library buildings as the crown of their educational
system.</p>

<p>Library science also will still progress ahead of its
building problems. Where its developments are to end
no one can foretell. What Bostwick<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> defines as the chief
modern features of American libraries—freedom of
access, work with children, co-operation with schools,
branch libraries of all kinds, all such expanding activities—are
sure to spread still further on the lines of social
science, industrial education and good citizenship, reaching
out, as Mr. Dana says, for the mechanic and the
artisan.</p>

<p>In building there will be serious problems to be
worked out. To college libraries will come the great
question of the economical and effective distribution of
department libraries. In all large libraries the problem
presses of how to store closely and still handily the
masses of accumulating books; underground stacks,
central artificially lighted book rooms, sliding presses,
mechanical carriers. In all large centers are impending
the enormous warehouses<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> of the future for dead or
moribund books, literary tombs or morgues.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span></p>

<p>I see another question impending,—Cannot modern
methods of steel construction help out the city problems
of light and congestion? Is the massive masonry, which
has made such dungeons out of most of our public buildings,
necessary for libraries? In view of the universal
opinion among librarians that every building will have
to be changed, enlarged, or replaced within a short
generation, in view of the fact that thick walls kill the
light needed for readers, that masonry partitions hinder
change, may not the structure that makes our modern
stores and office buildings so light, cheerful and airy,
be in some satisfactory way applied to our large
libraries?</p>

<p>Of one thing we may be fairly sure. Intelligent alliance
and the friendship of mutual respect between
librarians and architects will so carry conviction to
trustees that our buildings of the near future will seem
workable to librarians, satisfactory to architects, and
noble to the public.</p>

<p>For the remoter future our successors must plan. We
do our share if we pass on to them bettered methods
and finer buildings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span></p>

<h3 id="subhead-10">Firmitas, Utilitas, Venustas</h3>

<p>The motto I have chosen for this work is the maxim
embodying three essential qualities in building, as given
by Vitruvius, the leading authority in his profession,
in his work “De Architectura Libri Decem” issued over
nineteen hundred years ago at the highwater tide of
the classical style of architecture which some of his modern
successors have copied too blindly, forgetting that
the conditions of our <i>firmitas</i> and <i>utilitas</i> have essentially
changed and modified the twentieth century <i>venustas</i>.</p>

<p>Even at that age, note the order in which the author
arranged his attributes. <i>Venustas</i> last, even in that
era of magnificent architecture.</p>

<p>A fair translation of the motto would be stability,
usefulness, loveliness.</p>

<p>The second essential is the one as to which the librarian
is peculiarly qualified to speak, and of which he is
the especial champion, but he is greatly interested in
the two other attributes for which the architect is
more directly responsible, and perhaps the librarian can
help even here by suggestions.</p>

<p>He can certainly serve throughout the processes of
planning, in keeping, always and everywhere, all concerned
to the spirit of this classical architectural precept
so well rendered by the homely Anglo-Saxon adage,
“Use before beauty.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span></p>

<h3 id="subhead-11">Firmitas</h3>

<p>In the first place safety and strength of construction
must be essentials to everyone of the interested parties,
and must be planned for and closely watched by the
architect.</p>

<p>I was first attracted to the apothegm of Vitruvius by
the second item, but on dwelling on the subject I am
not so sure that the first is not quite as apposite. In
considering the Latin synonyms, I noticed that <i>firmitas</i>
had been used rather than <i>soliditas</i>, and on pondering
definitions in a lexicon, I found this under the head of
<i>firmitas</i>—“the quality of the <i>firmus</i>;” and under the
head of <i>firmus</i>—“strong, proper, suitable, fit.” Thus
Vitruvius builded better than he knew for modern
library building, and voted from the golden age of
classic architecture two to one against <i>venustas</i> in a
library building.</p>

<p>The librarian should constantly bear in mind first cost,
and cost of care as well as of administration. There
may be a choice between equally strong materials and
methods of construction. There may be choice as to
use of walls, floors, windows, partitions, lights, heaters.
In all these points affecting construction his watchfulness
should be constant and his practical advice should
have weight. He must warn also against unnecessary
heaviness and rigidity, and any methods which would
hamper changes or needlessly outlast the probable
life of the building. Massiveness is not now essential
to strength, and in a library building is a detriment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span></p>

<h3 id="subhead-12">Utilitas</h3>

<p>Here naturally the librarian must have pre-eminence.
While the architect may well correct inexperience in construction,
and may chasten poor taste in ornament, he
and the building committee ought to defer to the librarian
on all questions of administration, and only oppose
or override him where he is clearly unripe, “faddy” or
wrong. Certainly, in planning, the architect should
try patiently to meet all needs of storage or service as
presented by competent authority. Here is the core
of the problem: by the test of usefulness this particular
building is to be judged a success or a failure.</p>

<p>But the librarian should be sure rather than obstinate.
While he must be clear what he wants to do, he should
remember that there may be several ways of doing it.
If he is really an intelligent as well as an expert librarian,
he will often find in the architect a helpful inventiveness
to which he should yield an equal adaptability. Some
of the best library ideas are an architect’s development
of a librarian’s idea;—witness the stack.</p>

<p>As to a union of use and beauty, I would quote the
Alumni Committee on the Harvard University Library:<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
“Not only should the new library be as perfect in plan
and equipment as a wise and generous expenditure can
make it, it should also, avoiding any display of costliness,
possess a beauty and dignity of its own, both within
and without, that it may be a constant source of pleasure
and inspiration to all who use it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span></p>

<h3 id="subhead-13">Venustas</h3>

<p>I was first tempted to translate epigrammatically
strength, use, show, but show seemed just the effect
to avoid, although the <i>venus</i> suggested it. The lexicon
defines the meaning of <i>venustas</i> as loveliness, beauty,
charm; and I take it beauty—plain beauty—is what
we most wish to see in a library building.</p>

<p>“While it is undeniable that the more directly utilitarian
requirements should take precedence, æsthetic
treatment of a library building is no unimportant
matter. A building which is a work of art is a
powerful educational factor; a dignified structure commands
respect; an attractive exterior and pleasing
interior attract toward use of the building.”—<i>Champneys.</i><a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>The eleventh edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica,
in its article on Architecture, says this: “The end of building
is convenience, the end of architecture as an art is
beauty, grandeur, unity, power.” “The most important
qualities (it continues) are size, harmony, proportion,
symmetry, ornament and color.” Of these, size will
depend mainly on the scope of work of the library, and
on the funds available. Ornament in a library is a
questionable beauty. The other qualities are possible
even in a small and inexpensive building. For harmony
and proportion, the architect may well be allowed
choice at the outset as to what general form of building
would best suit the site, and accord with the
environment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span></p>

<p>I should add to the elements of beauty, material.
In this the next choice after cost, should be appropriateness
and possibilities of dignity and quiet beauty.
Nor need the material be expensive. Expense does not
always promote beauty; it often ensures ugliness. A
good rule to follow is to take “the wine of the country,”
as it were,—the stone of the state. Not necessarily
stone, either. Unless in large libraries, why is not wood
good exterior material, if the life of the building is likely
to be only twenty-five years? Wood is a fine material
for a small building, lending itself to easy alterations
or repair, and capable of great beauty. Whoever has
had the fortune to sail on Christiania Fjord or Puget
Sound has brought away, as pictures of loveliness, a
memory of the beautiful villas of those forest-rich shores.
Even re-enforced concrete, with its vast possibilities
of ugliness, has also possibilities of beauty: witness
the business section of Leipsic, and the residence quarter
of Hamburg. The different sections of America have
various handsome and durable building stones. And
every section is near enough to clay to have good brick,—by
far the most sensible, and in good hands the most
beautiful material for library building. Did you ever
see the buildings of Harvard University? If so, you
retain now in memory, not so much the gray granite
of the library, as the soft, homely, beautiful, wholly
satisfactory atmosphere of old Holworthy. If you can
escape the bilious brick which just at present is considered
æsthetic, and the other brick which exudes soda-blotches,
and get the good old-fashioned kind which mellows to
a ripe old age, you will please a large constituency.</p>

<p>As to marbles, if they are cheaper than stone or brick,
all right. But if additional expense for marble will
cripple or dwarf a single feature of convenience or
service, I would fight it to my last breath. Perhaps
I am prejudiced, by an early experience. Being in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
Washington some years ago, I wandered into the new
Navy Department Building. Asking to see the library
I was shown to a lofty, bare room paneled in marble
from floor to ceiling. “Here you see specimens of all
the marbles of the world, brought by vessels of the
navy direct from their quarries,” said the custodian.
“But where are the books to be?” I queried. “Oh, the
books!” he answered, rather contemptuously; “in here;”
and he showed me two slices of space, just the length
of the main room, shelved on both sides thirty feet high,
lighted only by a tier of single windows at one end, and
each space only eight feet wide. Since then, marbles
outside or inside a library have been associated for me
with vulgar show, not with appropriate <i>venustas</i>.</p>

<p>As to the quality of grandeur, I am not sure that it is
even appropriate to a library. Is it not some such
effect that many architects have aimed at in our bad
part? It seems to me that Beresford Pite was right in
saying:<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> “A regard for symmetrical purpose, a largeness
of proportion and form, simplicity of detail, and
great restraint and refinement of moulding and ornament,
are qualities characteristic of a library, internally
as well as externally.... Libraries of all buildings
should be freed from the trammels of a merely archæological
architecture. The architect of the present day is
apt to rely too simply on precedent.” Yes, witness
some of our Greek temple libraries in new America.</p>

<p>After all, the material to be used on the exterior is
largely controlled by the limit of funds and is a matter
for the architect rather than the librarian, unless he
thinks the cost of the outside will stunt his
accommodations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span></p>

<h3 id="subhead-14">Is There an Irrepressible Conflict?</h3>

<p>In the future must we face a continuous conflict
between the architect and the librarian? Is it true, as
was once said, that the architect is the natural enemy
of the librarian? Was Dr. Garnett right when he said,<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
“Hence a continual conflict between the architect who
desires a handsome elevation and the librarian who aims
at practical convenience?” Yes and no. No, certainly,
if we mean the word enemy in any but a Pickwickian
sense. No, certainly, if we expect a bitter fight and bad
feeling. But if we substitute the word “contest” for
“conflict,” if we look forward to eager but friendly
struggles, like athletic contests between colleges,—yes,
certainly yes. If both sides are striving for the
fine aims of Vitruvius, which I have taken as a motto—<i>Firmitas,
Utilitas, Venustas</i>—there will be nothing but
the amity and mutual respect of brotherly rivals. There
will not at first be full accord as to any one of the three
points. Sound construction, yes: but must that necessarily
be the construction of precedent? Use, yes:
but just the phases of use as seen by the untrained eyes
of that particular librarian? Beauty, yes: but exactly
the beauty of any conventional style?</p>

<p>“I do not believe there is a conflict between the
librarian or the committee, and the architect. There
is a common meeting ground.”—<i>E. B. Green.</i><a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>“The hostility between beauty and utility is often
more apparent than real.”—<i>Patton.</i><a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span></p>

<p>There will inevitably be differences, at first, even
among consulting librarians. Get together! Let librarian
and architect compare views until they find some
way of satisfying both, then present a united front to
the building committee. If, however, they cannot
agree, formulate their difference clearly and present it
to the committee for decision, as business trustees often
present doubts as to their trust, in a friendly suit before
a court.</p>

<p>But remember that it is a contest, and have the
library side presented as ably as the architect’s.</p>

<h3 id="subhead-15">Library Science</h3>

<p>Modern library science is yet in its adolescence as
compared with architecture, but it is a robust youth.
It already knows definitely what it wants, and what
it does not want. For guidance, it has a copious
literature of first instance, scattered through various
pamphlets and four score back volumes of periodicals.
It is beginning to have a literature of last instance,
in book form, like Duff-Brown in England and
Bostwick in America; and even a formal literature
about library buildings, Burgoyne and Champneys
abroad, and now this volume here. It is very satisfactory
to see how these three-thousand-miles-apart
authorities agree. There are still differences of method
to provide material for debate at the next international
conference, but we are close enough together on principles,
at least, to convince any doubting Thomas that
there is a library science to govern library building.</p>

<p>And in building there is the greatest need of further
developing library science. As Fletcher says in his
preface:<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>—</p>

<p>“One need not visit all the libraries of the country
to become painfully convinced that want of adaptation
to use is by no means infrequent. With regard to buildings,
Lord Bacon’s judgment seems very safe: ‘<i>Houses</i>
are built to live in, and not to Looke on: Therefore let
Use bee preferred before Uniformitie.’ If this is true
for houses, then <i>a fortiori</i> for libraries.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span></p>

<p>But the main reliance of architects and building committees
should be the living interpreter, the experienced
librarian who can expound, apply and extend the written
word. Here is embodied library science face to face
with us, to supplement every chapter of this book by the
latest developments; to explain apparent anomalies
and inconsistencies; to differentiate essentials from non-essentials;
to concede where concession is possible; and
to maintain with conviction the requirements to which
the architecture of tradition must yield.</p>

<p>Nor are the books closed with this volume. As a
writer in “The Dial,”<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> says: “The history of Library
Science is not closed. There remain an indefinite number
of interesting chapters still to be written which are
not unlikely to prove even more significant than any
that have gone before.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span></p>

<h3 id="subhead-16">Architecture</h3>

<p>Architecture, on the other hand, is a very mature
science. It is ages old, with a voluminous literature
from Vitruvius down, with many learned and skillful
votaries, who have thorough technical education. Indeed,
to a layman it seems a bit too much fettered by
education and precedent. But it has to tackle all
sorts of jobs from temples to stables, and it is very
much alive to modern progress. Witness its triumphs
with “skyscrapers,” steel construction, and re-enforced
concrete. It has an almost encyclopedic training and
can deal with all problems of itself, if required. But
for perfect work it needs a very clear and thorough
statement of the technical requirements of each problem.
Give him full information, and any good architect can
do good work.</p>

<p>The Century Dictionary defines Architecture as combining
the requirements of (1) use and convenience,
(2) constructive necessity and fitness, (3) artistic
excellence.</p>

<p>For buildings that are more practical than decorative,
the first is paramount, and it is on this point alone that
the librarian is qualified to speak with authority. The
other two-thirds—the larger part of the building—he
must leave to the architect. If all three points are
combined in the result, the architect should have two-thirds
of the credit, and if his library advice has been
defective, he should have the whole. And what does
he get in return, on a small building, except <i>kudos</i>?
Did you ever think how small a money reward he gets?
A lawyer or a surgeon may take, in a difficult case, all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
the client or patient has in the bank or can borrow. But
an architect, no matter how difficult his problem, and
how much he has to work it out for himself with incompetent
help, is limited to a percentage suggested beforehand
by a schedule of fees. For instance, Miss Marvin
gives views and plans of a $10,000 library at Darlington,
Wis., built by Claude &amp; Starck of Madison, which
she says meets perfectly the needs of a small library with
one slight exception. She reports the architects’ fee to
have been $379.85. For this they had to spend time
and thought on the plans, studying library science as
applied to that particular problem. They had to have
many sittings with librarian and board. They had
to pay draftsmen for elaborating several sets of plans.
They had to prepare specifications, invite, examine and
allot contracts, watch all the material that was put in
and all the work that was done. Were they overpaid?
In fact, were they fully paid for their work unless they
acted as their own draftsmen? All they really got out
of the job was the satisfaction of good work done, and
a certain amount of reputation, which I am glad to
help by this mention.</p>

<p>When an architect does such good work as this, as a
result of giving proper consideration to the real needs
of the library, he surely ought to have credit for it,
and all librarians who know about it ought to give him
thanks and wide public praise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span></p>

<h3 id="subhead-17">Where does the Library Come In?</h3>

<p>Architecture, as I have said, deals with a wide range
of subjects, from the pure idealism of tombs, monuments
and memorial arches, to the pure realism of
twentieth century workshops. The former are, so to
speak, all outside, and proper themes for competition.
The latter are nearly all inside, to be worked out by
careful and special study of their uses.</p>

<p>Where, in this wide circle, does the library come in?
All librarians will claim, and most architects will allow,
that it lies very near the workshop; as near it surely
as the schoolhouse. It certainly needs careful study and
adequate expert advice.</p>

<p>The tombs, monuments, and memorial arches, are
rich subjects for architectural taste and ornament,—for
<i>venustas</i>.</p>

<p>For workshops, for schoolhouses, ornament is inappropriate.
Good taste, shown in proportion, lines,
color, material, is still demanded, but they belong
clearly to the domain of <i>utilitas</i>.</p>

<p>The library comes, beyond doubt, in the latter group.
There is a vast range of buildings between, more or less
proper subjects of decoration and ornamentation.</p>

<p>But the library should incontestably be assigned to
the utilitarian extreme.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span></p>

<h3 id="subhead-18">What Conflict is Possible?</h3>

<p>Are there any points where architect and librarian
may clash? There will be many points of course where
they will differ at first, and have to get together through
argument. But are there any influences toward a deadlock?</p>

<p>On the part of the librarian there should be no
prejudice. If he be immature, or conceited and opinionated,
and only half informed, he may not deserve to
win in such a contest of ideas, but his bias at all events
would be professional, not selfish.</p>

<p>On the side of the architect, however, might there not
be some bias? In the first place, professional bias toward
some style he has got his mind set on? He may be
too willing to sacrifice <i>utilitas</i> to <i>venustas</i> on this account.
During the Boston Public Library discussion, an architect
wrote to a daily journal: “Library buildings should
be treated as monuments, not as workshops, and must
be made beautiful even at the sacrifice of utility.”
But if any architect or any trustees now have such views,
the building committee is to blame if it employs him, or
even admits him to a competition.</p>

<p>In two points, however, selfish considerations might
bias an architect, if he were poor or ambitious. In the
first place his remuneration is by percentage on the total
cost. The more his client spends, the more pay he gets.
This situation conflicts with economy. In the second
place, his reputation and his future prosperity depend
not so much on librarians as upon the general public,
which admires size, costly material, decoration, show.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
Witness the constant reappearance in magazines of the
worst libraries as examples of good architecture. Marching
with his own artistic temperament, this conflicts
with economy, utility, and simplicity.</p>

<p>As to the danger of such a conflict, I personally have
little fear, if some care is taken in selecting the architect.
I know many of the profession. All of them I
believe would spurn the first temptation, as they would
an open bribe. Some of them might be influenced
insidiously by the second, under the guise of Pure Art.
But if shown by an expert librarian, worthy of belief,
that any architectural beauty would tend to cripple
the work of the library, I believe that every one
would yield his views promptly and willingly. Indeed,
on the first point, I have known an architect to
sacrifice his own interest knowingly.</p>

<p>See anecdote at the bottom of <a href="#Page_131">p. 131</a> proximo.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span></p>

<h3 id="subhead-19">What Contest is Likely?</h3>

<p>Putting aside any question of such serious conflicts,
are there any differences to be expected? Why not
leave it all to the architect, with what information he
can get from the local librarian? There are a number
of points to be settled both in the interior plan and
about the exterior as affected by the interior. The
question, for instance, of the best size and collocation
of rooms, and height of stories, for effective and economical
administration. The questions of shelving and
furniture, always differing somewhat from previous
problems. Such questions as ornamental fireplaces and
massive furniture, and ornamental as against effective
lighting. Questions as to the irreducible minimum
of entrance halls, passages and stairways. All these
on the interior:—on the exterior, the height of the
basement, the height of the front steps, the height of
stories and the arrangement and shape of windows,
expense of material and decoration as against more
space and better facilities inside. All these questions
are open to honest difference of opinion between a
librarian and an architect whose motives and ends are
the same. And the architect with preconceived ideas,
and a bias toward architectural effect, ought to have library
views explained to him by some librarian who is his
equal in experience, education, ability and personality.</p>

<p>The conditions have bettered in recent years. “The
librarian’s ideal and the architect’s ideal, years ago
wide apart, are today coming closer together. Full
comparison of views may lead to agreement.”—<i>Hamlin</i>
(architect).<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span></p>

<h3 id="subhead-20">Where Lies the Blame?</h3>

<p>Where should the blame of bad buildings rest?
Sometimes, certainly, on the architect. Perhaps he is
incompetent, perhaps he has been wilful. Champneys
(an architect himself) says of the English situation: “In
many cases architects have wilfully sacrificed utility to
æsthetic considerations.”<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> And so often in America.
I have recently heard of an architect chosen to build
a library with only a limited fund available, calling for
twenty-five per cent more money for more expensive
material, before he had begun to lay out the interior.
Here the blame should rest on the architect, unless he
acted under positive orders from the committee.</p>

<p>But the architect is not always to blame. Sometimes
the librarian has not been strong enough or has not had
enough experience to guide him aright. Sometimes a
“faddy” librarian has led him to adopt features which
the profession generally disapprove. More often the
building committee have left the problem to the architect
without proper instructions, or have actually
instructed him to disregard librarians’ advice, and to
make the building showy at any sacrifice of use.</p>

<p>The board of library trustees, not the librarian, is
the architect’s client, whose instructions he must obey.
In many cases the parties in fault have been the
trustees, or ultimately the public. “The worst possible
combination is that of board and architect, the librarian
being ignored.”—<i>Bostwick.</i><a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>So do not blame the architect for a poor, clumsy,
extravagant building, unless you can surely place the
responsibility on him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span></p>

<h3 id="subhead-21">Grades and Classes</h3>

<p><b>Grades.</b> In dealing with libraries, it will be well to
grade them by size, or rather by cost, which will accomplish
the same end; and to arrange them by scope.</p>

<p>Any grades must be arbitrary, but as some attempts
at distinguishing small from large have already been
made, rather loosely, I will try to group them as I think
they can be treated. Thus:—</p>

<ul>
<li><i>Minimum</i>, those costing under $5,000.</li>
<li><i>Small</i>, those costing from $5,000 to $20,000.</li>
<li><i>Moderate</i>, those costing from $20,000 to $75,000.</li>
<li><i>Medium</i>, those costing from $75,000 to $300,000.</li>
<li><i>Large</i>, those costing from $300,000 to $1,000,000.</li>
<li><i>Very large</i>, those costing more than $1,000,000.</li>
</ul>

<p>Miss Marvin<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> seems to hint at $3,000 as the limit
for very small libraries, but I note that $5,000 is a more
frequent limit for Carnegie gifts, so I follow that guide.</p>

<p>The next grade I limit to $20,000, on a suggestion
from Miss Marvin<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> that it is unwise to attempt a two-story
building for less than that sum. The third limit,
also, I assign because Miss Marvin says that it is unusual
and unadvisable to have an architectural competition
for buildings of less cost than $75,000. The other groups
are deduced from my own experience.</p>

<p>I shall deal with only two of these groups at length,
“Minimum” and “Very Large.” The very small, or
“minimum” libraries are adequately dealt with by Miss
Marvin, Eastman, and A. L. A. Tract No. 4. See,
however, later under the heads of Plans, and also paragraphs
under all heads which fit small libraries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span></p>

<p><b>Classes.</b> Arranging libraries according to their scope,
I classify them thus:—</p>

<ul>
<li>Private.</li>
<li>Club.</li>
<li>Proprietary.</li>
<li>Institutional.</li>
<li>Professional.</li>
<li class="isub1">Scientific.</li>
<li class="isub1">Law.</li>
<li class="isub1">Medical, theological.</li>
<li class="isub1">Special business.</li>
<li>Government.</li>
<li>State.</li>
<li>Historical and antiquarian.</li>
<li>University.</li>
<li>School.</li>
<li>Public.</li>
<li class="isub1">Branches.</li>
<li class="isub1">Suburban.</li>
</ul>

<p>Of these, I will treat Private and Club libraries in one
chapter, Proprietary, Institutional and Professional in
another, Government, State and Historical in a third,
University, College and School in a fourth. To Public
Libraries I will devote a separate chapter. “Branch”
and “Suburban” I will consider in my chapter on Public
libraries. To some one of these classes any collection of
books may be assigned; any collection, that is, which
might require separate treatment in this volume.</p>

<p>Mr. Belden, chairman of the Mass. Public Library
Commission, writes me of the especial need of suggestions
for small libraries, “which are springing up like mushrooms,
most of them very poor specimens of what a
good small library should be.... Trustees in small
libraries are usually better planners than the librarian.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span></p>

<h3 id="subhead-22">Small Library Buildings</h3>

<p id="subhead-23"><b>Minimum.</b> For this grade of very small libraries
having, on the Carnegie ten per cent basis, not much
more than $500 a year to spend, there would seem to be
still need of a special manual. Eastman has only two
illustrations and Miss Marvin only one, in this grade,
most of their plans being far more costly. In A. L. A.
Tract No. 4, I gave about ten pages which would be
especially useful to very small libraries. Eastman and
Miss Marvin place the limits of a small library much
higher than I do. It seems to me that a library—perhaps
not the very smallest, but certainly one that could
spare $10,000 for building—would know at least where
to go for advice. But the minimum grade librarian
would be apt to be an amateur or a novice, and her
board would hardly know much about libraries or library
personnel. To them clear, succinct, systematic suggestions,
illustrated by just such views, floor plans and
statistics as Miss Marvin has given, would be a very
great help, especially in new and isolated communities.</p>

<p>If she, with Mr. Eastman’s assistance, could compile
another manual or tract, confined to libraries which
especially need specific advice, cannot afford to pay for
it, and are situated at a distance from any experienced
librarians, I think they would do very great good. Such
libraries may even copy model plans if thus carefully
selected and commended.</p>

<p>To condense here a few principles,—it is best to rent an
inexpensive room and furnish it very simply, until the
trustees have felt their way, know what to do and have
say a thousand dollars in sight to build with and enough<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
funds to run a building. But “it is desirable to get a
library out of rented quarters as soon as possible.”—<i>Utley.</i><a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>“A building is a good thing; it makes the library
mean more to the public. Build to save light and coal,
build to save work in keeping neat and clean, build to
allow for growth, build so that one person can control
and do all the work.”—<i>Ranck.</i><a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>“A plain one-story wooden building built on posts,
with only one room, heated by a stove, lighted by oil
lamps, very simply lined with wall shelving, furnished
with the plainest of tables and chairs, will do at first.”<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>“The public library in a small town is usually its only
intellectual center.”—<i>O. Bluemner.</i><a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> And it may become
its pleasantest social center.</p>

<p>The first development would be to a one-story, one-room
building on foundations, but not with finished
cellar or basement. Perhaps a fireplace could be added,
with more and better furniture and shelving, so planned
that different corners and separate divisions of shelving,
still under control from a central desk, could begin the
rudimentary divisions of a library; reference, light
reading, children. Serious reading would have to be
postponed, or pursued under difficulties.</p>

<p>The next stage would still be confined to one open
main floor, to be under one central supervision, built on
the trefoil plan, center and two wings, in three rooms,
or rather three parts of one room, divided by cords, rails,
glass partitions or low bookcases. To this could be
added at the back another projection, to be used as the
reference library, or for open shelves. “In the trefoil
plan, the end wall of the book room at the back might
well be all glass, with no windows at the sides. This<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
would be very easy to extend.”—<i>O. Bluemner.</i><a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> Up to
this time, no provision need be made for a private room
for the librarian.</p>

<p>But about this stage it is time to think of a raised
cellar or basement, which will about double the available
floor space and begin to allow division into departments,
the first increase of force being a janitor who
can act as supervisor of the lower rooms.</p>

<p>Soon after this a regular trefoil building can be erected
with practicable basement, with the introduction of
two small rooms at the inner corners of the back ell,
where they need not block light from any room.</p>

<p>From this on to a two-story building with stairs, there
are many alternatives, and no regular style of building
can be prescribed.</p>

<p>When a town has no adviser at hand, it can apply
to the state library commission, or if there is none in the
state, to the nearest state commission, which at least
can advise from what librarian it can get good advice.</p>

<p>Most of the very small libraries described in the 1899
Report of the Mass. Free Public Library Commission
occupy a room or rooms in schoolhouses, town halls,
churches, the librarian’s house, or public blocks. The
smallest grade of separate library buildings seem to me
more uniformly appropriate and beautiful than many of
higher grades.</p>

<p>As I drive about seashore and mountain resorts and
through small country towns, I see many beautiful little
library buildings, usually closed at the time I pass, so
that I cannot inspect the interiors. In the 1899 Report
of the Mass. Free Public Library Commission, I find
descriptions of several low-cost library buildings. For
instance:—</p>

<p class="noindent">with several others costing less than $5,000 and many
costing $10,000 or less. Of some of these, exterior
views are given in the report. I should much like to see
interior views, floor plans, full statistics and comments
of local librarians.</p>

<p>In A. L. A. Library Tract No. 4 I said, and still think,
that—</p>

<p>“A rough, unpainted, cellarless, one-room wooden
building could be put together for say $250, and can
be fitted up and made comfortable in all weathers for
as much more.</p>

<p>“From $1,000 to $2,500 will pay for a tasteful wooden
building amply sufficient for a library of not over 5,000
volumes.</p>

<p>“$2,500 to $5,000 will erect a similar building, to
hold 10,000 volumes or more.</p>

<p>“From $10,000 up will provide for a brick building,
and from $15,000 up a stone building for growing libraries
of 15,000 volumes or more, with the varied functions
that such a collection implies.”</p>

<p>These figures are only an approximation and will vary
in different sections, with prices of material and labor,
but they will do for rough guess to start with.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span></p>

<p>The only comments in Miss Marvin’s pamphlet which
seem specially to apply to this grade are these:—</p>

<p>“A building costing $3,000 or less cannot have library
rooms in the basement.” (p. 5.)</p>

<p>“A $5,000 building usually consists of one large well-lighted
room, with basement for storage and workrooms.”
(p. 5.)</p>

<p>“Small buildings will be the same as the $10,000 buildings
in the points of light, shelving, etc.” (p. 5.)</p>

<p id="subhead-24"><b>Small Buildings.</b> But the grade from $5,000 to
$20,000, which probably will include a large majority
of American libraries, would be apt to be more sophisticated,
to have a bright and even a trained librarian, and
one or two practical trustees who could seek advice
intelligently, get at similar libraries in their neighborhood
or state, pick out a good architect, and not need
precedents quite so much. Their problems are much the
same as those of larger libraries. Their need of features
looking towards economy of administration and effectiveness
of supervision with a small force would be
greater; but they would begin to have many of the
essential functions of larger libraries; especially, in our
rapidly developing communities, the interior and exterior
provisions for growth which require such intelligent
forethought and careful planning. Whatever may be
thought of larger problems, here is the place for an
experienced library architect, one who has already built
a small library which stands the test of use, some clever
and sympathetic young architect, perhaps, who has
already shown his skill as a builder and his taste
as a designer, but who is not too busy to give
some of his own time to the task. With such an
architect, thoroughly commended by librarians who
know his work, there may not be need of a paid
library expert.</p>

<p>Koch gives illustrations of ten library buildings in
this grade, besides several branch libraries whose cost
is not stated. Miss Marvin gives twelve illustrations
in this grade; Eastman ten.</p>

<p>In this “small” grade would come many branches
and many suburban libraries.</p>

<p>Some English plans show a two-story head-house,
with a one-story extension to the rear, lighted from the
roof. Why would not this plan work well on narrow
and deep city lots?</p>

<p>Since writing the above, I have had a letter from Miss
Marvin, from which I quote, “I should like to suggest
that you advise small libraries to consider their state
library commissions as their official advisers in the
matter of building. They could help in detail work,
pass upon their plans, and above all prepare the instructions
for the architect before he begins to draw. Out
in our part of the country in smaller towns, there are
very few competent architects, and a great many
beginners, who do not ask or expect instructions from
the library boards. They simply draw pictures of their
ideas of interiors and exteriors of libraries.”</p>

<h3 id="subhead-25">Moderate and Medium Libraries</h3>

<p>Buildings to cost anywhere from $20,000 to $1,000,000
present much the same kind of problems, varied more by
class than by cost, but growing more complicated, of
course, with increased size and scope.</p>

<p>To quote again:<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>“As a library grows, the rudimentary divisions still
prevail, sub-divided according to special needs, such as
<i>Separation of books</i>, as under art, music, patents, etc;
<i>Separation of work</i>, as librarians, delivery, janitor, etc.;
<i>Separation of readers</i>, as adults, children, serious and
light reading, etc.”</p>

<p>The architect’s special parts of the problem, construction
and exterior, grow rather less than the librarian’s.
The latter’s problems increase with the number of departments
and rooms, The principles remain substantially
the same, but their application to the relations of
books, administration and readers requires more study.
The necessity for special experience and maturer judgment
becomes greater and greater, and the librarian’s
side of consultation needs strengthening with every
thousand cubic feet of size to be apportioned rightly.
With increased size the diversities of use between different
classes of libraries become more technical and intricate.
Unless the local librarian is expert and mature he needs
an able and experienced adviser to be able to hold his
own with the architect, who will wish his problem more
thoroughly and authoritatively presented as it becomes
more complex.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span></p>

<h3 id="subhead-26">Very Large Buildings</h3>

<p>The buildings to cost over a million dollars are likely
to be in the state, public or university classes. Some
of their peculiar phases will be discussed under those
heads. The features they have in common are size,
material and construction, entrances, stack, relation of
stack to reading rooms, underground stories, stairs and
elevators.</p>

<p>Material and construction are perhaps the most
problematical. As has already been questioned, must
libraries be of solid stone construction like most of our
recent public buildings? Must they be gloomy dungeons
like our typical custom-houses? One objection to massive
and imposing build is the burden of shade imposed
on the inside rooms and corridors by thick walls, deep
window embrasures, rows of columns, porticos and
overhanging cornices. Can they not be given sufficient
dignity and yet be of modern steel construction, like
our business blocks that are so light and airy? Or, if
an imposing front be necessary, why not plan it with
columns, portico and approaches, as a mere façade to
mask three other exterior walls and partitions of light
construction? One important consideration toward this
end is the belief of librarians that every building may
require alteration, enlargement, possibly replacement in
less than a generation, and ought not therefore to be
too solid.</p>

<p>Why not put the stacks on the front and sides, thus
giving a light construction tone to the building?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span></p>

<p>If such a daring experiment could be made for a very
large library, it would lead to omission of impressive
outside stairs and rows of useless columns, which often
incumber entrances and largely increase the cost of
library buildings.</p>

<p>The stack, still in the course of development in smaller
libraries, must be studied as the principal problem in a
very large library.</p>

<p>Room to store enormous and continually enlarging
stocks of books will be required. Where to put the
reading rooms is a minor problem, the chief query
being where to give them the best daylight, either outside,
or on courtyards, or under the roof; to leave ample
space for them, not too far from books and administration
rooms. Could a large enough stack be built on
what might be called the daylight fronts and the daylight
stories? The question of dark, central or underground
stacks will be discussed in a separate chapter.
It is only outlined here as one of the chief problems of
the very large building.</p>

<p>Elevators and mechanical carriers, house telephones
or speaking tubes will furnish larger problems the
larger the building is to be.</p>

<p>Inside stairs and passages, just large enough, no
larger, than will be required for use, and so carefully
placed as to unite, rather than separate, departments of
the library, will in themselves be a special study both in
service and in economy of space and cost. The more
unnecessary cubic space, width, length and height, you
waste on them, the more your library will cost to build,
and the more will be the annual expense of caring for
it and of repairing it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span></p>

<h3 id="subhead-27">CLASSES</h3>

<h4 id="subhead-28">Private and Club Libraries</h4>

<p><b>Private libraries</b>, while a frequent problem for architects
(in the United States there were over a hundred
thousand in 1870, averaging 250 volumes to a library,
according to the ninth census) have not much to interest
librarians, who are seldom called in to run them. A
private library is oftenest a more or less casual collection
for the use of the owner and his family. Occasionally
it expresses some special taste in reading or
collecting. But whatever it includes, it is at the same
time a store room and a reading room for a very few
persons, as it was in old Roman times, so that it would
be fitting for the architect to take the old Roman tone
in its treatment, the tone of the Vatican library in miniature.
Wall shelving, open or glassed cases, carvings, free
decoration, busts above the bookcases, friezes, whatever
he thinks appropriate and cozy, may be used in it.</p>

<p>Gladstone in his interesting article on “Books and
the Housing of Them”<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> describes an arrangement for
twenty thousand volumes (evidently his own library)
“all visible, all within easy reach, in a room of quite
ordinary size.” He sketches a floor plan of shallow piers
or alcoves all around a room 20 × 40, with most of the
centre left open for furniture. This plan is worth looking
up by an architect charged with planning so large
a private or club library.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span></p>

<p><b>A club library</b> is only an extension of the private
library idea, to be used by many men rather than by a
few. Here the tone may be the same, varied perhaps
by the first formal monastic features.</p>

<p>Here alcoves might well be used, with no rigid steel
stacks, but handsome wooden shelving.</p>

<p>Just few enough men could find quiet seats, with books
all around them, a cozy window seat with a leaded
window to look out of, not too many other readers or
busy attendants to disturb their quiet by hunting books
on the neighboring shelves.</p>

<p>A private or club library is a good subject for an architect
to exploit, taking beautifully bound books as the
key to his ornamental treatment. Quiet, artistic lights
are appropriate, rich old woods and decorative rugs;
everything that is taboo in a public library. The keynotes
should be rest, comfort, literary cosiness, private
proprietorship; if anything more, refined hospitality
to personal friends.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span></p>

<h4 id="subhead-29">Proprietary, Institutional</h4>

<p><b>Proprietary.</b> By these I mean what might be called
literary clubs, owned in shares, and supported by dues,
like Athenæums. Most of these combine some of the
features of club libraries, and the reference and circulating
functions of public libraries. Their constituency
is smaller, however, more select, and usually has a
higher degree of literary taste. In building, they will
usually need rather more of the home or club atmosphere
than other classes of libraries, and much less
supervision. Here, for instance, the alcove and the
window-nook might properly be used in reading rooms.
The readers would be fewer, even in busy hours, and
more homogeneous, so that a nervous man might pre-empt
an alcove or a window seat and remain for hours
comparatively undisturbed by either attendants or by
other readers. Such societies will rarely build until
they have a stable membership, many books and an
accomplished librarian. From him the architect can
learn the characteristics and habits of the members, and
can begin planning by studying the features that will
please them. As to the shelving of books, the administration
and delivery, their problems will be much like
other libraries, with perhaps more open access, especially
to the new books for circulation.</p>

<p>The old-fashioned Mercantile Library, of which some
survive in vigor, is similar in support, but more democratic
in membership, and ought to be treated architecturally
more like a public library, without children’s
rooms or such social science features.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span></p>

<p><b>Institutional.</b> Under this group I would include
the libraries of endowed or charitable societies, such as
Young Men’s Christian Associations.</p>

<p>If these are wealthy enough, they might have separate
buildings or wings or stories for library use. Usually,
however, they can only afford to set aside rooms or
suites in buildings largely devoted to other purposes,—offices,
class rooms, lectures, gymnasium. In such case,
the library should be carefully planned to give it the
best frontage and light.</p>

<p>Where there can be ample, and if possible separate
elevator service, the upper floors, with some light
through the roof, would probably offer the best opportunities.
Rooms elsewhere in the building would give
club facilities, so that feature of proprietary libraries
might be omitted. The usual storage for books and good
reference and light-reading-room facilities should be
provided. If teaching is prominent in the plan of the
institution, something like seminar rooms in colleges
might be planned near the library, and private rooms for
teachers and advanced students.</p>

<p>The administration of the library would probably be
separate from that of other departments. The library
might then be shut off from the rest of the building
by sound-proof partitions, opening from a main corridor
or from stairs and elevator, so as to be quiet and complete
in itself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span></p>

<h4 id="subhead-30">Professional</h4>

<p>This group might be sub-divided into scientific,
medical, theological, law, and special or business; each
requiring individual treatment and the advice of a
librarian of mature experience in just that specialty.
Here again the library will often be housed only in a room
or a suite of rooms, to which should be assigned the best
possible situation in the building, bearing in mind
quiet, light and easy access. The users will be so select
and responsible that they can be allowed full access
to the shelves. Their use will be like that of professors
or graduate students in a university. Wall
shelving around rooms in which there are tables for
readers; or where many books have to be assembled in
one room, shallow alcoves and wall shelving opposite
good light with tables near the windows; would be suitable
arrangements for such rooms, with a minimum of
service and supervision, and of florid ornamentation.
Where a separate building is possible, other features
might be added. Then, of course, general considerations
would apply as to storage of books, administration
and accommodation of readers.</p>

<p id="subhead-31"><b>Scientific.</b> These would probably be libraries of
separate or affiliated societies, in a building with club
features; really specialized club libraries, for members
only. They would be reference libraries almost entirely,
without much circulation. Alcoves and wall shelving
would be appropriate, with tables and racks for professional
periodicals, and facilities for writing, without
much probability of a great rush at any one time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span></p>

<p id="subhead-32"><b>Medical.</b> These would have much the same use as
scientific, much the same quarters, much the same
treatment. They would generally be larger, often with
separate buildings. Special thought would have to be
given to periodicals, the current numbers and back sets
of which form a large proportion of the literature of this
profession.</p>

<p>There were only thirty medical libraries listed in the
government report of 1876, and very few of these appeared
to have separate buildings. It would seem
appropriate, in this class, to have a museum in the same
building as the library, to illustrate the professional
literature graphically.</p>

<p id="subhead-33"><b>Theological.</b> The majority of such libraries would
be attached to schools or colleges and partake of the
treatment of departments in universities. There are a
few large general theological libraries, however, with
separate buildings. Quiet study, open access, slight
supervision, inexpensive service, are their requisites.
In theological schools it may be desirable to have class
rooms near the library.</p>

<p>Separate rooms for quiet reading and writing would
always be a convenience, if funds allow.</p>

<p>Where much attention is paid to the older literature
of theology, a special provision of shelves for folios and
quartos would be required.</p>

<p id="subhead-34"><b>Special and Business.</b> As these libraries have
recently formed a separate society or section of the
American Library Association, they evidently have
unique subjects to discuss, but few of them have attained
the dignity of separate buildings.</p>

<p>They generally have to content themselves with a
suite of rooms. Each one has its individual character,
and can be ranked perhaps in the scientific and professional<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
classes, except that any one library will probably
have a more restricted group of readers, consisting of
the partners and employees of the maintaining firm or
establishment.</p>

<p>If the problem of providing such rooms comes to an
architect, he should get instructions from the proprietor
and librarian as to its special needs in shelving and
other facilities.</p>

<p>In Chicago especially, where part of expense of such
libraries is sometimes assumed by the Public Library,
they cover a wide field of usefulness and assume proportionate
importance.</p>

<p>Their number seems likely to increase rapidly as large
firms differentiate, become wealthy, and can use technical
libraries for the solution of manufacturing and
commercial questions arising so frequently in every-day
business that time and expense can be saved by
having their own books handy instead of getting them
from more public libraries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span></p>

<p id="subhead-35"><b>Law.</b> Literature of this class has such a peculiar use that
law libraries need separate treatment and merit a special
chapter. They are sometimes small, as county law
libraries; or large—law-school, bar, city, state. They
will usually be assigned to rooms in state capitols, city
halls, or court houses, and trustees should exert early
and strenuous efforts toward getting good and adequate
locations assigned to them.</p>

<p>With good elevator service, it is certain that a whole
top floor of the building, or the top floors of a roomy
wing, will give the quietest, lightest, and most commodious
quarters.</p>

<p>As both the study and practice of the law largely rest
on precedents, the books which are most frequently
cited have to be shelved close to ample table or desk
facilities.</p>

<p>No matter how ample these are, every seat is apt to
be filled during the busy hours of the day.</p>

<p>Lawyers like to look up, pick out, and themselves take
to their desks, the books they want to use, and therefore
there should be open access to all the shelves.</p>

<p>Alcoves are proper here, but more for extending shelf
room—really wide open-access floor cases—than for
study, which is better at tables.</p>

<p>Space enough is desirable on the main floor for all
the books in common demand and for most of the
readers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span></p>

<p>The quarters recently obtained by the Social Law
Library in the new extension of the court house in Boston,
though not especially erected for the library, are
very satisfactory. They comprise a long, lofty room,
thoroughly lighted from high windows, with wall and
alcove shelving opposite the light; with gallery possibilities
for future growth; an opening to the main story
of a stack; and a few rooms for hearings and quiet
brief-making. The alcoves are wide enough for passing,
but not for study at table. The long tables occupy that
half of the length of the room which adjoins the outer
wall and have ample diffused rather than direct daylight
from windows high up in the wall.</p>

<p>One thing the Boston Social Law Library could not
obtain space for, and which would be very desirable,
is a sufficiency of private study rooms. In planning for
the library, a circular with questions was sent to several
large law libraries. One question was, “How many
private rooms could you use?” All answers called for
several rooms; one librarian would like to have fifty.</p>

<p>The tendency in all libraries is toward ample opportunities
for quiet study, but in law libraries, authors, investigators,
makers of briefs, especially need privacy and
abstraction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span></p>

<h4 id="subhead-36">Government: Historical</h4>

<p id="subhead-37"><b>U. S. Government.</b> Libraries for the United States
government are generally located in the national capitol.
One has a separate building, the Library of Congress.
The others are attached to the Departments and housed
in the Department Buildings.</p>

<p>They may be treated much as law libraries are;
indeed a large part of each of them constitutes a law
library. Set aside for them well-lighted rooms with
a good aspect, in a quiet part of the building. If the
rooms are as lofty as the floors of the ordinary department
building require, arrange for a two or three-story
steel stack. There will be limited service to be provided
for, limited circulation, and a rather limited
and well-defined storage.</p>

<p>A special problem may soon come, in the form of
legislation for a Supreme Court building, which must certainly
provide for the consultation library of the Supreme
Court, and perhaps for a great part of the Congressional
Law Library. In the first instance, the collocation of
court room, consultation room, judges’ private apartments,
and library, will have to be carefully studied.
If the main law library is to come to the new building,
it will preponderate architecturally, with the necessary
reading and study rooms for the bar. Strong common
sense, and able library and juridical advice, will be required
to avoid smothering the very definite uses of such
a building in architectural embellishments.</p>

<p id="subhead-38"><b>State.</b> Each state in the American Union has
at least one “state library” at the capital, usually in the
capitol, maintained at public charge primarily for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
use of state officers, legislators and courts. Latterly
they have become also central reference libraries for
schools, colleges and citizens throughout the state, and
traveling library centers, requiring special facilities for
these services. They also require storage for public
documents—very near dead literature, fit for close
and perhaps dark storage. The growth of state libraries
is phenomenal, largely from exchange of documents
with other states and the United States, an immense and
rapidly increasing literature (quadrupling every twenty-five
years) which must be shelved in some form.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“There must be a division of a state library into law,
documents, and miscellaneous, with a separate building
for law and documents.... I am inclined to see the
ideal state library as a great warehouse building. I
want a dignified, simple, fireproof building; with heat,
light, ventilation, conveniences for work, the very best
that can be made, and without a dollar for elaborate display.”—<i>Johnson
Brigham</i>, State librarian of Iowa.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In building new state capitols, and in replacing old
ones, there is considerable work ahead. In such an
impressive and dignified building as the people want,
the real needs of departments of the government, especially
of the library, get scant consideration. To the
library is often assigned some part of a prominent
wing whose features, height of stories, size and arrangement
of windows, style of shelving and furniture, are
largely governed by supposed exigencies of the exterior,
developed before the interior has been planned. It will
require superhuman effort on the part of librarian to
get model library quarters into such environment, but
tact, early work, and persistence can often ameliorate
conditions. Galleries and alcoves you will probably
have to accept and do the best you can with, but it is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
open to some daring architect to build a stack in full
sight, occupying the back half of the inevitable high
room, with stack windows on the outside, giving an organ
tone to the façade, and an open stack front within to
give a similar tone to the interior.</p>

<p><b>Separate Library Buildings.</b> Large states have
already begun to give separate buildings to their general
or at least to their law libraries (see <a href="#subhead-35"><i>Law</i></a>). Such a
segregation is to be commended, if space and money can
be afforded, for here the library problems can be
treated without prejudice, unhampered by traditions
of American State Capitol Architecture.</p>

<p>“I am sure I would never put the State Library in the
Capitol. The number of books the state legislature and
officers use is very limited.”—<i>Dewey.</i><a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>Simple construction, appropriate fenestration, interior
planning beforehand with definite purposes, disregard
of outside flights of steps and porticos, compression
of inside passages to a minimum, quiet and restful
shape and coloring, may yet produce buildings both
useful and beautiful, which people of taste will come
thousands of miles to see. Here is a fertile field for state
librarians, state commissions, and talented architects.</p>

<p id="subhead-39"><b>Historical.</b> Though not always on the same grounds
as the state library, most such libraries are situated at
the capitol, and have similar characteristics. They
ought surely to have dignity and nobility of style, as they
have in subject. They are entirely reference libraries,
and should have preponderant accommodations for
students and investigators, but in proportion to their
size they have needs as to storage of books and for
readers, very like those of other reference libraries. So far
as they include antiquities, they need museum rooms and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
corridors in their buildings, usually assembly and lecture
rooms, and always large fireproof safe rooms or vaults.</p>

<p>See full floor plans of the Wisconsin State Historical
Society Building.—<i>Adams.</i><a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p id="subhead-40"><b>Genealogical and Antiquarian.</b> So far as libraries
are called distinctly antiquarian rather than historical,
the museum function increases. Antiquities, even
strictly literary, require different treatment from books.
Glass doors for larger wall cases, glass cases for manuscripts
and incunabula, merit wider corridors and rooms
of different proportions, with different lighting. There
must be more screens and free wall room for maps,
engravings and pictures. There must be different service
and supervision.</p>

<p>Genealogy has become such a favorite fad, and has
so many societies which foster it, that separate space,
perhaps separate buildings, will have to be provided for
it. The features of such buildings, however, need have
no marked distinction from historical and antiquarian
libraries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span></p>

<h4 id="subhead-41">Educational</h4>

<p>The library needs of all these educational institutions
are similar. It has been said that there are three
classes to be considered,—professors, graduate or advanced
students, and undergraduates.</p>

<p>The ordinary youthful students do not get much time
for general reading and do not need unrestricted access
to all the shelves. If they can get at general and special
reference books, their own text-books, and the books
recommended by their instructors, it is all they want.</p>

<p>The professors and teachers, however, and to a certain
extent advanced students, may wish to browse anywhere,
and can be trusted to go anywhere. They want facilities
for examining and selecting books in the stacks, they
want quiet rooms to take books to (perhaps several books)
where they can read, copy and write.</p>

<p>The professors want department and “<i>seminar</i>” rooms,
shelved sometimes for permanent sub-libraries of their
own technical books, always for books of present use
in their daily classes. They also like to have individual
rooms for study, and for their records.</p>

<p>The relation of these rooms to the general library is
the peculiar and pressing problem of scholastic library
building. Dr. Canfield said that the question, shall departmental
libraries be included in the building of the
general library? has not two sides, but a dozen.</p>

<p id="subhead-42"><b>School Libraries.</b> These should not perhaps be
treated here, as they rarely, perhaps never, have separate
buildings. But as schools rise in grade, or are grouped
in large buildings, their libraries may attain size and
individual character, and the rooms assigned to them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
need careful planning. Good light first, with cheerful
aspect; an accessible central position; wall shelving,
combined perhaps with shallow alcoves opposite windows;
spaces and tables for teachers and for scholars of different
grades; a central space for general reference books,
an attendant, and what passing to and fro is necessary;
as good artificial light as the classrooms,—these would
seem obvious desiderata.</p>

<p id="subhead-43"><b>College.</b> Colleges and universities vary little except
in size, and perhaps in the proportion advanced investigation
and large departments bear to prescribed undergraduate
study.</p>

<p>Rather open stacks, with carrels, would be preferable
in a college; a good general reading room, or a suite of
rooms slightly differentiated; nooks and private desks,
with a private room or rooms for professors; wall shelving
in professors’, class or seminar rooms, with shallow
alcoves or floor cases at end of rooms for possibilities
of enlargement.</p>

<p>Simple, central, inexpensive administration, with tubes
or telephones to different rooms and departments; a
central position in the college group or building, ample
provision for growth, as gifts come in—these points
suggest themselves.</p>

<p>At the St. Louis Conference in 1889, a suggestion was
made that inasmuch as the library is the heart of a
university, it should be given a central position from
which the other buildings should radiate.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p id="subhead-44"><b>University.</b> Many universities are so large that
most of their problems have been suggested in the
chapter on Very Large Libraries.</p>

<p>Here the question of seminar or department libraries
becomes acute. In some respects it is analogous to that of
branches to a public library, but it is far more complicated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span></p>

<p>How many departments are to be provided for; how
far can they be served from the main library; if they
are to have separate libraries, how large should these
be; do they need permanent libraries, or only books sent
from time to time; how far shall they duplicate the
contents of the central library; how far shall they have
department librarians under control of the general
librarian? All these questions affect the planning of
buildings.</p>

<p>Law and medicine generally have separate buildings
and separate administration. As to other departments,
systems vary in universities. Indeed, no two seem to
have the same system. The one adopted at Brown is
simple, inexpensive, efficient. This assigns all the departments
to a separate building, not far from the central
library, and connected with it by telephone, tunnel,
and mechanical carrier. This building has a central
room for one attendant. Round him are grouped the
reference books needed by all departments, and any
professor, through him, can call books at will from the
delivery desk at the main library. In this arrangement
each department can have its own shelving, and its
head can have an adjoining private room, with convenient
storage for his own books and papers.</p>

<p>A system, some variety of which seems common, provides
wings or galleries on various floors for the seminar
rooms, more or less conveniently served from the main
library.</p>

<p>Other universities have their departments dotted
around the grounds, wherever they happen to have been
placed from time to time, without apparent reference
to the library, and served from it only by messenger.</p>

<p>Others have seminar rooms built in various forms
near the library building, with bridges or arcades between,
by which they have access to their own branch of literature,
stored in an adjacent part of the library.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span></p>

<p>Others again have rooms fitted more or less cleverly
into the body or corners of a general stack. A very
convenient location would be a special seminar
story over the stack, with both top and side light,
which would allow a large number of rooms of any
required sizes.</p>

<p>Without the seminar complication, Mr. Patton<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> is
perhaps right in saying that the college library presents
a simpler problem than the public library, for it has less
circulation, and no children to deal with; but with it,
especially on a large scale, this is one of the most perplexing
puzzles of library planning.</p>

<p>Mr. Patton also suggests<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> that the best location for
a college library is one that does not require architectural
façades on all sides, and that a slope backwards has
advantages. The same may be said of many other
kinds of libraries.</p>

<p>In a recent number of the <i>Popular Science Monthly</i><a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
it is suggested that a university might be built in a
compact group, with a common façade, as beautiful
as possible; offices and lecture rooms to be directly
behind this show front; the library occupying a
central position further back, flanked by the departments,
all connected and all built on “the unit
plan” for easy enlargement sideways, endways, up,
or down.</p>

<p>In recent projects, there seems to be a tendency toward
schemes for a college group, evolved evidently not from
the use of the several buildings, but from desire for architectural
harmony. Those interested in the library should
strive to have it omitted from any such general scheme,
and relegated to any modest position in the background,
where its details could be worked out without any such
exterior bias.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span></p>

<p>The position of the general reading room is another
major problem. In a small college it can be put, as a
single room or a suite, almost anywhere within easy
reach, near the main entrance, and preferably on the
main floor. In a large university a one-story ground
floor room in the center of the building, just back of the
main entrance, not too high (lest the roof cut off too
much light from the lower windows of the wings opening
on the courtyard), would seem to be a good location.</p>

<p>Administration rooms, as in other libraries, should be
central, well lighted, suitably collocated, and quiet.
The delivery desk would better be separate from the
reading room, unless it could be combined with the
service desk in that room, and so placed toward
the entrance end or side as not to let the stir and
noise disturb readers.</p>

<p>Where to put the catalog cases adjoining both departments,
with good light, is usually another puzzle
inviting study.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span></p>

<h4 id="subhead-45">Public Libraries</h4>

<p>“For the American people the library of the future
is unquestionably the free public library, established
with private or public funds, and maintained wholly
or in part at public expense under municipal control.”—<i>Fletcher.</i><a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>“The ‘public library’ is established by state laws, supported
by local taxation and voluntary gifts, and managed
as a public trust. It is not a library simply for scholars,
but for the whole community, the mechanic, the laborer,
the youth, for all who desire to read, whatever be their
rank or condition in life.”—<i>William F. Poole.</i><a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>“The library of the immediate future for the American
people is unquestionably the free public library, brought
under municipal ownership and control and treated as
part of the educational system.”—<i>Dana, L. P.</i><a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>The building of the public library must recognize and
serve these noble aims. The idea of public libraries is
as old as Rome; their aims are essentially modern in
their democracy.</p>

<p>“Modern ideas of the functions of a public library
are,—lending books for home use; free access to the
shelves; cheerful and homelike surroundings; rooms for
children; co-operation with schools; long hours of
opening; the extension of branch-library systems and
traveling libraries; lectures and exhibits; the thousand
and one activities that distinguish the modern library
from its more passive predecessor.”—<i>Bostwick.</i><a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span></p>

<p id="subhead-46">The impulse of these ideas should be practically felt
in the planning of buildings. Precedents, models, the
fetters of architectural style, must be thrown aside
where they impede or hamper progress. Architecture
must march side by side with Library Science, should
even lead it and show it the most effective ways to work
out the new idea.</p>

<p>In the first place, “cheerful and homelike surroundings”
do not accord with lofty rooms, vast halls, and heavy
architecture; and dazzling decoration must not repel
the man in a working suit.</p>

<p>Popular features should not entirely banish books and
accommodations for students. “Every public library
should be a library of study. Besides professional scholars
and teachers, even authors or editors among residents,
there are students in the higher schools, university
extension students, members of literary clubs, cultivated
college graduates, lawyers, clergymen, who should find
congenial facilities in a building meant for the whole
community.”—<i>Fletcher.</i><a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>On the other hand, it would be a shame to let such
serious reading and literature crowd out any popular or
educational features, or take an undue share of the
construction or maintenance funds.</p>

<p>What should be especially planned for, is inviting and
cozy provision for the ambitious young men or women
who want to educate themselves either by general
reading, or by the special literature of their occupation
in life; and for the tired women whether housekeepers,
workers or idlers, who can find in books or
magazines or papers relaxation and recreation from
their home burdens.</p>

<p>Children’s rooms, now always a principal feature to
be planned, will have a separate chapter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span></p>

<p id="subhead-47"><b>Branch.</b> The branch library, as distinguished from
distributing or delivery stations, has its own building,
and deserves as careful study as the main library in a
small city. Branches vary from merely local stations
relying on main libraries for most of the administrative
work, to branches practically independent. The problem
of branch libraries has come into prominence recently,
especially since Carnegie has made so many gifts in
this direction. Most of them fall into the “small”
grade, but in large cities many rise to the “moderate”
and even “medium” figures. One branch library in
Philadelphia, with special endowment, cost $800,000,
but that is very exceptional.</p>

<p>The first question is site. Good authorities say that
there ought to be branches about a mile apart; one, that
is, within half a mile’s walk of any family. Crunden
says,<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> “The ideal would be to have a branch library as
often as we have a public school.” The average constituency
of branches in Great Britain is said to be
60,000. In this country it has been suggested that
there ought to be one for every 40,000 dense population,
or one to 25,000 in opener districts. But there can be
no invariable rule. Circumstances differ as well as
available funds.</p>

<p>Chas. W. Sutton of Manchester, in an article on
branch libraries,<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> summarizes:—</p>

<p>“There should be a lending library for every 40,000
in close populations, 25,000 or 30,000 in scattered
communities.</p>

<p>“Placed on car lines in the thick of the population.</p>

<p>“Not more than a mile apart.</p>

<p>“Never more than 15,000 volumes in stock.</p>

<p>“A majority consider 10,000 volumes a great sufficiency
even in a large city branch.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span></p>

<p>“No library with less income than $7,500 should
try branches. It would be cheaper to pay borrowers’
carfares to and from the main library.”</p>

<p>See <i>Bostwick</i>, “Branches and Stations.”<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>A good general rule is to watch neighborhoods, especially
outlying districts, and notice where schools or fire
department buildings are demanded, and where little
groups of local stores spring up. These groups usually
form in the most accessible localities in new districts.
It has been said that branches in residence quarters
are more used than those in business centers. This
is undoubtedly true of business sections in large
cities, but, nevertheless, even locations in residence
quarters should be chosen for ready access, and
ready access with local demands has already selected
such locations for stores in smaller places. A lot
near a schoolhouse is always good: it is handy for
the children.</p>

<p>Like other small libraries, branches have to be planned
for easy supervision and economical service, hence, all
departments should be on one floor, with high basement,
if possible, for janitor, heating, toilet, and possible social
service functions, like classes and lectures. Provide for
delivery, a few quick-reference books, and a limited
stock of books to be lent.</p>

<p>The number of books to be shelved will vary with the
constituency, from 2,000 to 15,000 volumes—the fewer
the better. When once settled, no growth need be provided
for, as disused books can be sent back to the central
library from time to time, to make place for new
books. Nor will administration grow largely. But
growth in the parts allotted to different kinds of reading,
to children, and to social service functions must be provided
for, inside the building preferably.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span></p>

<p>Corners, or railed-off parts of rooms, will separate
periodicals and other light reading from children, reference
books and delivery desk. Readers should be able
to choose books and help themselves by absolutely open
access, to minimize cost of service. Very little provision
need be made for serious readers, who can be
referred to the central library. If any cataloguing is
to be done at the branch, a librarian’s room must be
provided. If not, and there is only one attendant, an
enclosed delivery desk is enough, and the space usually
taken up by a librarian’s room can be given to books or
readers.</p>

<p>The conditions in city branches will be very similar
to those in small towns, with perhaps less of the neighborhood
club, and more of the social service idea, without
any problems of increased storage of books, and with
more difficulties in foreseeing changes.</p>

<p>As to cost, a report to the city of New York recommended
$5,000 for small branches, and up to $10,000
for large ones. But in Brooklyn and other cities, separate
branches for sections as large as, and situated like,
suburban towns, have cost as high as $150,000.</p>

<p>A very interesting case of establishing several branches at
once may be found in a description of the Brooklyn plan.<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>In New York city, to get more branches than could
be afforded in buying expensive sites, and to get them
where they were wanted, single buildings in the midst
of blocks have been taken.</p>

<p>In England, many of the newer branches include
“social center” functions, not only ladies’, boys’, ratepayers’,
conversation, and attendants’ tea rooms, but
even in one case a restaurant, which is expected “to
provide a large share of the cost of maintenance.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span></p>

<p id="subhead-48"><b>Suburban.</b> Suburban libraries differ on the one
hand from country libraries in remote regions, and on
the other from branches in cities. They are near enough
for “team work” with the library system of the city
in whose suburbs they lie, but they serve an independent
community, often jealous of its privileges. They
have not quite the problems of growth of the country
library, because they can have an inter-library loan
system with the city libraries, or can arrange to refer
to them many inquirers and students. This possibility
may limit the size and expense of their buildings, and
the necessity of providing for unlimited growth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span></p>

<h4 id="subhead-49">Exceptional Cases</h4>

<p id="subhead-50"><b>Middle of Blocks.</b> Occasionally, as with the present
Cincinnati Public Library, and with the New York
City branch libraries, circumstances require the location
of the building in a block. Of course this necessity
is a handicap. The problem of giving all the departments
good positions and full light is difficult when there
is space all round the four walls, but when both side
walls are blank, ingenuity is required in providing all
the requisites for every department. Natural light
everywhere is impossible, and artificial light must be
largely relied on. Whatever features (like closets and
stairs where there are no books to be picked out or
read) can be assigned to the middle or waist of each
floor, will leave more chance for front and rear use of
clear daylight. The top floor can be all utilized with
top light. A light well from the center of the roof will
mitigate the dimness of illumination on staircases and
entries. The experience of New York is valuable for
such problems, and would doubtless be freely available.
But it is a good rule to avoid such locations, if possible.</p>

<p id="subhead-51"><b>Top Floors.</b> Exigencies of income may require a
Board to rent part of their building, as in the case of
many of the “Mercantile” libraries which still survive.
While the St. Louis Public was a school-board library,
it had this experience. In these days of roomy and rapid
elevators, such a necessity is not so bad as it seems,
especially if one or two rooms in a public library could
be left on the ground floor. At the top there is usually
good air, comparative quiet, coolness, and light, even
in smoky cities. Modern methods of construction carry<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
great weights safely, and it is possible to plan service
and reading rooms on the top floor with one or two-story
stacks beneath, giving fine accommodations with
good business suites earning income, on floors beneath.
Separate elevators for business and for library purposes
are, however, essential.</p>

<p id="subhead-52"><b>Museums or Art Galleries in Same Building.</b>
There is so rarely enough money available to allow
as much room as the library wants, and there is
usually so much friction in operating more than one
institution under one roof, that while there is general
belief in the value of museums and galleries as public
undertakings, there is great unanimity among American
librarians that they are better apart. Few librarians
with us have the training which would fit them to
undertake the superintendence of such different departments,
and fewer still would like to be superintended
by a musician or scientist. Yet, if together in one
building, there should be one superior officer for all, even
if he be called only custodian. The difficulties of planning
a building to provide properly and amply for more
than one of these three functions are just three times
the puzzle of planning for one. Where a city wants to
try it, or a donor insists on it, it is far better to plan
a group of three buildings on one large lot, with such
connection by arcades as would give a pleasing architectural
bond, without shutting out any light, at least
from the library.</p>

<p>Those who are interested in such combinations are
referred to the English library books and magazines,
<i>passim</i>. The union of libraries and museums in England,
indeed, is so common as to be recognized in the Library
Acts. If art or other exhibitions are a feature of the
library management, they can be provided for as suggested
under the head of exhibitions elsewhere.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span></p>

<p id="subhead-53"><b>Alterations and Enlargements.</b> Often existing
residences or halls are presented for library use. The
proverb, “Never look a gift-horse in the mouth,”
does not apply in such cases. The gift building ought to
be examined all over by experts—an expert librarian
and an architect, if possible—before it is accepted.
It will often be found to cost more for alteration, before
the old building can be quite suited to library purposes,
than a plain but satisfactory new building would cost.
Certainly it is unwise to hamper library efficiency out
of a sentimental regard for a donor, alive or dead.</p>

<p>If the building is found susceptible of inexpensive
alterations, which would render it entirely suitable for
such work as the library wants to do, it will evidently
be unwise to trust the task to an architect, inexperienced
in library alterations, or even to the advice of an immature
librarian. Here, if ever, is there need, from
the side of economy as well as the side of utility, of a
wise library expert, for fear of making a botch.</p>

<p>So in making alterations in an old library building
which requires enlargement, do not accept the hasty
suggestions of even the most ingenious and confident
trustee, or the prentice plans of a callow librarian or a
young architect. Get the best plan you can secure
from the best authorities. The best will be none too
good for you. Justice to your successors and to the
next generation requires the utmost care in piece work.</p>

<p>See an article by Miss Annie B. Jackson,<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> on items
and expense of alterations at North Adams, Mass.
The repairs there proved to outrun the estimate.</p>

<p>When you get your tentative plans and your rough
estimates, get also a rough estimate for a new building.
You will often be surprised to find how near the cost of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
alterations will come to that of building. If it turns
out so, better wait and get your ideal rather than patch
up a makeshift.</p>

<p>But if, after deliberation, you vote to alter, there is
one wise end to aim at, that is, to spend as small a part
of your available funds for mere alteration, and as large
a part for features which could be utilized later for a
permanent building, as may be possible. Witness, for
instance, the recent experience of the Salem Public
Library.<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> They had pressing need of more room, but
could use only $70,000 for changes, not enough for such
a new building as they wanted, or could afford while
they had a perfectly sound old residence to use. But
by ingenious planning, they have been able to get a
stack with an administration head house, to which they
can add later a main building when they need further
enlargement. They have spent a minimum in temporary
changes on their old dwelling-house, and have
besides retained enough money to build a branch library.</p>

<p id="subhead-54"><b>Altering New Buildings.</b> It is not only old buildings
that need altering. Too frequently a good librarian,
alive to progress, and faced with the problems of
growth, finds himself promoted to a beautiful building
of such recent erection as to be financially exhausted,
and indisposed to spend money in necessary additions
or alterations. The question confronts him, how get
more room with the least cost?</p>

<p>In this fix, he will first look inside and see where he
can house more books, more readers, more attendants.
Here shortcomings of the architect may perhaps afford
him at least temporary relief. The most likely fault he
finds will be wasted space, perpendicularly or laterally.
Two faults are bad; they cannot even be converted into
virtues. These are domes and ornamental staircases.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
Domes, to be sure, can be circled with galleries to which
unused books can be sent—a very brief palliative.
And elevators or lifts may be cut into stairs. But such
makeshifts will not serve.</p>

<p>More opportunities may be discovered in spacious
vestibules, in wide corridors, in lofty stories. The vestibules
and corridors can be narrowed to simply useful
width, and their exuberance partitioned off into rooms.
Mezzanine floors can also utilize waste upper spaces.</p>

<p>If money cannot be found for partitions and floors,
for iron and wood and paint, I see a good use for sliding
cases, in the form Professor Little has at Bowdoin—just
two or more stories of this contrivance, set out in
the corner or at the side or in the middle of any useless
stretch of floor.</p>

<p>Tables and chairs can invite an overflow of readers
in any space not needed for passage; temporary wooden
shelving can be set against any corridor wall; administration
desks can be protruded into any architectural
waste. When you go to Washington, see what Mr.
Bowerman has done at the Public Library there.</p>

<h3 id="subhead-55">SPIRIT OF PLANNING</h3>

<p>Every new library building should be thoroughly
planned with a view to its class, scope, size, funds, site,
environment, experience, and cost of administration.
True economy begins with a good plan. Not only
present cost but future annual costs depend on it.</p>

<p>The main thing in beginning to plan, even in the first
consideration of building, is to set your ideal high. If
your funds are not yet provided do not take it for granted
that they will be meagre. Study the scope of your
library, look hopefully into its future. What work
should it do now; what growth should it get in the next
twenty-five years? What size and area are needed to
meet your utmost possibilities in that time? Consider
first only the essentials—they will be costly enough.
When you have made careful calculation of actual needs
(and nothing else) ask your donor, town or institution
for what would cover them. Do not at first include
expensive material or ornament. If the body that is to
pay requires elegance, calculate cost of this and present
it as a separate question.</p>

<p>Set your ideal of utility high, and ask enough to cover
it. If you cannot get it, then and not till then will be
time to decide what to surrender.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span></p>

<p>If the amount to be spent is already fixed, still study
ideals first. Can we get all the requisites for this library
within that sum? If it is evidently impossible; if building
thus would stifle usefulness or stunt growth, ask
for more. But if you cannot get it, or if you think the
appropriation can be made to cover the work, the ideal
to aim at is to pack into the building ample accommodation
for every function you will need to cover.</p>

<p>Above all, make these calculations ahead. When the
sum is finally fixed, resolve to plan so carefully that the
final cost will come within the appropriation. Like a
note to pay, this obligation is peremptory.</p>

<p>“The main ideas are, compact stowing to save space,
and short distances to save time.”—<i>Winsor.</i><a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>This axiom written a generation ago would serve to
head this chapter now. Also this, “In building, as in
management, the wants of the great masses of the public
must be kept constantly in view.”—<i>Poole.</i><a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>“The evolution of a design is not such a simple matter
that the finished idea can be produced in a short time,
but it must depend on a gradual evolution, based upon
a thorough study of the local conditions.”—<i>Patton.</i><a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>“A building can be made both beautiful from the
architect’s standpoint and useful from that of its
occupant, by constant consultation between them, by
comparison of views at every point, and by intelligent
compromise whenever this is found to be necessary.”—<i>Bostwick.</i><a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span></p>

<h3 id="subhead-56">Taste, Tact, Thrift, Thoroughness</h3>

<p>The spirit of planning is summarized in the apothegm
on the frontispiece of this volume.</p>

<p><b>Tastefully.</b> Although Vitruvius reckons beauty
third and last among the requisites of building, I can
put taste first, because good taste covers both beauty
and use and should be the prevailing characteristic of
every detail of a library building.</p>

<p><b>Tactfully.</b> Webster defines tactful as a discerning
sense of what is right, proper, or judicious, and this
sense applied to the details of library planning would
certainly tend to perfection.</p>

<p><b>Thriftily.</b> “Economical management” should be
the keynote embodied in every detail of library building.</p>

<p><b>Thoroughly.</b> This should be the pervading and
controlling spirit. Plan to the very end; aim for the
very best; slight no least detail.</p>

<p>This is so essential to proper planning that it deserves
a separate chapter. To lack of thoroughness on the
part of building committees, much of the disappointing
character of existing buildings is due. They choose an
architect directly or by competition, and give him inadequate
guidance in his task.</p>

<p>An architect knows much, especially where to look for
knowledge, but it is too much to expect him to master
in a month or a year, together with a score of other
investigations, the intricacies of a complex and rapidly
developing science in which only a few librarians are
expert after a lifetime of study and practice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span></p>

<p>The committees, not experts themselves, have not
secured a library expert to formulate their problems
thoroughly. Perhaps they have delegated to their own
librarian a branch of library science which he does not
know by experience, and cannot be expected to learn
in a short time by study; especially as his normal duties
of running the library fully fill all his waking hours,
and part of his dreams. It is not so much a lack of
thoroughness on the part of the committee as an entire
lack of comprehension of how much there is to be
thorough about.</p>

<p><b>Use Every Inch of Space.</b> Begin at the foundation
and study every detail. Study every entrance, passage,
stairway, room, floor, piece of furniture, stretch of shelving,
up to the roof; sketch as you go, sketch not loosely but
to scale. Fit your parts together; leave no waste space,
no dark corner unutilized. Measure zealously and save
every inch of length, breadth and height; every useless
cubic inch costs money and wastes room. Plan a closet
under every open staircase. Watch especially the height
of every story and every room. Do not allow any foot
of height not imperatively demanded for light or ventilation.
Allow nothing for mere architectural effect.
Search even attic and ceiling to utilize unutilized corners.
Do not blame the architect, blame yourself, the library
expert, for any waste of space and money.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span></p>

<h3 id="subhead-57">Economy Paramount</h3>

<p>In public buildings, the duty of rigid economy is clear,—economy
in cost, economy in space, provision for
economy in administration. Even with a lavish donor,
his generosity should be guarded by economy, especially
if he does not endow his institution lavishly enough
to provide for upkeep and efficient management. This
is an age of extravagance, not only the extravagance of
luxury, but that of necessity. With invention and improved
comforts of living, the luxuries of our fathers
have become the necessities of our children. This is
just as true of libraries as of households. Even with
larger incomes than our fathers, we have to be economical
to live in health and comfort. With libraries
and with families as their income increases their
wants increase—they never have enough. Especially
is forethought needed in building a larger house.
Do not spend too much on it; do not build it beyond your
means. But get everything into it you can reasonably
afford to use. So with a library building. If you have
a given sum to spend, plan very carefully to get all
possible space and convenience for the cost. If you
are planning to ask for an appropriation or a gift, plan
carefully to ask for no more than you actually need;—your
needs are sure to require as much as you can afford.
The tendency to extravagance is even more marked in
public buildings than in private life. Except in the case
of rich men who feel the increased burden of taxation,
the average citizen is apt to vote money for schools and
libraries and city halls, without careful enough inquiry
into details and with rather a liking for show. But every<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
real friend of libraries ought to oppose extravagance as
watchfully as he would oppose parsimony, and plan so
that a given amount of money will do the most good.
Use and not show should be his motto. Treat the library
liberally, but do not allow the library building to take
so much as to cramp the other good work of the community.</p>

<p>“One of the most difficult features of the problem is
adapting the views of librarian and board to the cost
limit.”—<i>Hamlin.</i><a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>“Plan well within your limit; extra wants will come
up as you progress.”—<i>Eastman.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span></p>

<h3>Cost of Running</h3>

<p>Not only first cost but future annual cost of administration,
depends upon careful planning of the building.
Care and repairs of expensive material and ornament;
cleaning, heating and lighting useless floor space or
height; inconvenience in use; separation of departments,
will require more attendants and more money,
with worse service to the public.</p>

<p>“Extravagance in library building is not so often
found in lavish ornament as in that unfortunate arrangement
of departments which requires three attendants to
do the work of one or two.”—<i>Eastman.</i><a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>“The salary of an extra attendant represents the interest
on a sum which would go far to make the arrangement
of the parts of the building what it should be.”—<i>Fletcher.</i><a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>Duff-Brown<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> calculates that lighting, heating, repairs
and cleaning cost from 13 to 16 per cent of the annual
appropriation for a library. This percentage can be
kept to its lowest limit by good planning, or increased
by bad planning.</p>

<p>“A plan most economical in cost of building is often
most economical in cost of working.”—<i>Champneys.</i><a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>“A simple plan is better and more economical.”—<i>Eastman.</i><a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>Not only economy of construction but economy of
administration is imperatively demanded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span></p>

<h3>The Worst Extravagances</h3>

<p>The very worst possible waste in building a library
is doubtless unduly expensive material and unnecessary
ornament. These items often mount up into tens and
even hundreds of thousands. They are worse than mere
waste, they are positive detriments.</p>

<p>The next worst is perhaps architectural competitions,
which are spoken of at length elsewhere.<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> They are
sure to cost a deal: payment for an advisory architect,
payment of prizes, payment of the jury. Here again
there is more than waste, there is delay, a false start,
deliberate care to put exterior before interior.</p>

<p>The third common extravagance is parsimony in
experts’ fees. Champneys<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> in speaking of architects’
errors, says that “to this fact must be attributed the
suggestion that librarians should dispense with the services
of architects, and design their buildings for themselves.”
This suggestion may have been made in England,
but never in America, even in acute periods of
despair over the trend of building. No American librarian,
no building committee, would think of dispensing
with an architect, though they might try to economize
by getting a cheap one.</p>

<p>But it is just as wasteful to cheapen your library
adviser as your architect. Because it has a librarian
already, or because the architect chosen is willing to
tackle the job without expert advice (perhaps more readily
because he resents advice), or because it is inclined to
contemn and resent advice itself, the committee often
commits willful extravagance at the outset, saving at the
spigot to waste at the bung, by going poorly equipped
into a serious task.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span></p>

<h3 id="subhead-58">Economy of Expert Advice</h3>

<p>But “penny wise is pound foolish.” Saving first
cost is not always true economy. It would be foolish
indeed to save on architect’s fees. For a little one-room
wooden building, to be sure, a local carpenter
might do, under the supervision of a clever librarian or
a practical trustee. But as soon as the building gets
complex, get an architect. His fees will save enough in
convenience, in comfort, in grace, in beauty, in actual
money outgo to contractors, to prove themselves the
best economy. Just so, as the problem gets still larger
and more complex, get the advice of an expert librarian
to help present it to the architect. He will more than
earn his fees by keeping down useless waste of space;
by pointing out how to economize in running expenses;
by aiding the architect to enhance the beauty of the
building; by promoting and thus expressing its true
purposes.</p>

<p>I have now had some personal experience in this
matter which I will put into percentages. From what
I have seen, I not only believe, but know, that one per
cent of the cost of building, put into employing a really
competent expert librarian, will save from ten per cent
to forty per cent on the cost, in space, convenience and
material. If you doubt, why not verify the facts by
inquiring of some trustees or donors who have tried the
experiment? They are surely unprejudiced and credible
witnesses. One per cent spent in saving ten per cent is
a net economy, worth at least considering.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span></p>

<p>This principle, first applied to library matters by
Henry J. Carr in 1891, has been recognized recently
by the Mayor of Rochester. Having in hand the establishment
of a central library and a system of branches, he
sent for a leading librarian of great experience, got his
advice, for which a liberal fee was paid, and no doubt
thus saved for the city thousands of dollars which might
otherwise have been wasted in experiments and bungling.</p>

<p>“The internal arrangements should be devised by a
person practically acquainted with the working of such
a library as the building is intended to accommodate,
and not by architects or building committees” (or inexperienced
librarians) “without such experimental knowledge.”—<i>Fletcher.</i><a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>“There is an increasing disposition in planning libraries,
to turn to experts,”—<i>Foster.</i><a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>No experienced librarian would allow without vigorous
protest such waste of space and money as is referred
to in the Boston <i>Transcript</i><a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> thus: “The increased cost
of administration in some of the newer palatial library
buildings is alarming. In one, the cost was nearly
threefold, in another nearly fourfold what it was before.”
This might have been saved, or at least largely reduced,
by paying a modest fee to a good expert.</p>

<p>Calculate the cost of each cubic foot of wasted space,
the cost for twenty years to come of lighting, heating,
cleaning and repairs for useless space; the salary of
additional attendants to care for unnecessary processes,
and you will find that economizing on advice will waste
thousands of dollars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span></p>

<h3 id="subhead-59">Problem Always New</h3>

<p>It is folly to try to copy except perhaps in a minimum
grade library—in embryo or rudimentary form.
Perhaps in a very small and remote community, without
a trained librarian, with no experienced librarians near,
and far from a library commission, it would be safe to
ask a local builder or carpenter to duplicate some small
building pictured in such a manual as I have suggested,
by Miss Marvin and Mr. Eastman. But never except
in the smallest grade.</p>

<p>Even among the libraries usually called small, there
are differences of site, location, community, state of
development, size, methods, aims, funds, prospects of
growth, which will distinguish or should distinguish each
new building from all other buildings. As soon as a
library begins to have a character of its own—and this
development comes early in America—its library
problem merits and absolutely requires independent
study. Every community, every institution, wants to
have a library suited exactly to its characteristics, and
the library should have a building suited exactly to
its character.</p>

<p>“The problem presented to an architect by a library
board is always essentially new.”—<i>Mauran.</i><a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>“Special and local conditions place a new problem
before the builder every time.”—<i>O. Bluemner.</i><a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span></p>

<h3 id="subhead-60">Plan Inside First</h3>

<p>Librarian and architect should collaborate from the
beginning in every interior detail. The exterior should
not even be considered until the interior has been entirely
mapped out.</p>

<p>This elemental maxim does not appear to have been
laid down until the formulation of the “Points of Agreement.”
Indeed, the first mistakes in building libraries,
and the mistakes still too often made, may be attributed
largely to the search for precedents in style, the formulation
of the exterior before what it is to hold or express
is defined. Most architectural competitions (except
those held to dodge responsibility in selecting an architect)
arise from an impression on the part of the building
committee and the board and community they represent,
that the looks of the library building, the effect
it makes on the public, is the main thing to secure,
not so much the proper housing and handling of the
books.</p>

<p>The whole argument of this volume is that a library
<i>is a library</i>, a book- and study-workshop or factory;
only incidentally an ornament; no more, certainly, than
a schoolhouse needs to be. If so, its motives are all
utilitarian, to be studied out first of all, thoroughly and
faithfully, before a thought is given to exterior conditions,
or any details of exterior or interior ornament.
This consideration should be reiterated and hammered
into the consciousness of all concerned—architect,
committee, community.</p>

<p>“Taking into account the practical uses of the modern
library, it is readily seen that it needs a building planned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
from inside and not from without, dictated by convenience
rather than taste, no matter how good.”—<i>Fletcher.</i><a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p>“Consider the plans first, rather than the elevation.
The outside of the library building is its least important
feature.”—<i>Duff-Brown.</i><a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>The buildings planned thus, by gradual development
of ideal interior arrangements, are very likely in
the hands of a skillful architect to turn out architecturally
beautiful. For the designer, as he has advised
about structural points has gradually evolved from these
details a harmonious conception of what the library is
to be and do, the relation it holds to its surroundings
and to the public, until an ideal scheme of proportion
and sympathy flashes into his mind, and Utilitas has
led him up to complete Venustas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span></p>

<h3 id="subhead-61">Never Copy Blindly</h3>

<p>I should not suppose that any building committee
would be senseless enough to “convey” an exterior from
another building labelled “library,” and try to cram
their own institution into it, but in reading a recent
number of <i>The Librarian</i> of London, I found this paragraph:<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>
“Within the last few weeks the surveyor was
instructed to draw plans from a photograph of another
institution.... Without knowing all the factors going
to the making of the plan of a library in another part
of the country it would be impossible to say, without
consultation, that they would be suitable for the particular
circumstances of this one.” But it is not necessary
to go so far abroad for a warning. We all remember
that eminent trustees and a distinguished architect
went farther to appropriate a design, and imitate it
here in America—not often accused of poverty of
invention. The cult that admired it, admired it so much
as to copy their borrowed work for buildings they labelled
“libraries” all over the United States. If you do not
realize the fidelity of this “copy,” and if you own
Champney’s “Public Libraries,” look at page 134, “The
Boston Public Library,” and then turn to “Bibliothèque
Ste. Geneviève, Paris,” opposite page 139. And if you
have Burgoyne’s “Library Construction,” read pages
255 to 257, which reflect in mild and courteous terms
the criticisms of American librarians on this architectural
plagiarism. To recall the criticisms of Winsor, or
Poole, or Cutter, would not be so mild.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span></p>

<p>As a result of similar mistakes, librarians are united
as to slavish imitations of exteriors or interiors, but
perhaps some small libraries might be willing to copy
an interior arrangement more or less closely. Before
doing so, however, they should secure overwhelming
testimony as to the practical merits of the plan as
adapted to new needs; and even then a practical librarian
and architect could probably find modifications which
would make it more thoroughly fitted to all local conditions.
Certainly another plan ought not be copied
until after careful consideration of all present and
anticipated requirements of the problem in hand.</p>

<p>“No library can be successfully imitated from another.”—<i>W.
A. Otis</i> (architect).<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>“No model plan can be said to be best.”—<i>Burgoyne.</i><a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>“It is useless to attempt setting forward an ideal
plan.”—<i>O. Bluemner.</i><a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p>“A building committee is not likely to secure what
it wants by copying or even by competition.”—<i>Eastman.</i><a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>Study precedents always and thoroughly, but do not
try to follow any of them implicitly, nor expect to find
a type or model you can imitate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span></p>

<h3 id="subhead-62">Study of Other Libraries</h3>

<p><b>By Visit.</b> The best preparation for planning, and
later the best test and corrective of your plans, will lie in
visits to other libraries of like grade, size, character, and
constituency as your own, especially if their librarians
are intelligent, experienced, and thoroughly frank about
both the merits and the faults of their buildings, and
will tell you what to avoid as well as what to imitate.
Observe carefully (with note-book and pencil in hand)
size and collocation of rooms; height of walls; dimensions
and make of furniture; suitability and finish of
all materials; effect of coloring; placing and size of windows;
distribution, effectiveness, and economy of
artificial lights; all the various points which will aid you
in solving your own problems. Carry a measuring tape,
and get all dimensions down to scale. If your architect
can go with you, at least on a second or review trip, so
much the better. If he cannot do this, have specific
recommendations ready for him at your next conference.</p>

<p><b>Examining Plans.</b> Next to personal visits, intelligent
inspection and comparison of plans will help you
after you have gone some way toward formulating your
own plans. I would not advise too premature, or too
promiscuous study of plans. There are so many accessible
to a searcher, of so many different grades, and such
varying degrees of excellence, that indiscriminate and
reckless inspection is very apt to bring on mental
dyspepsia.</p>

<p>Disregard at first exteriors, which distract attention
from essentials. Confine yourself to floor plans and
interiors of libraries of your own size and class. Preferably<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
take modern plans, certainly those of leading libraries
in all sections which are imbued with the modern
progressive ideas. You will find no lack of material.
If you use it wisely and eclectically, it will help clarify
your ideas. Note the plans which seem to you best;
go back to them again and again; at each study discard
those which are less satisfactory; and when you have
reduced your list to a few very nearly right, compare
them with your own sketches until you are quite sure
that you have incorporated all their best points.</p>

<p>You will not perhaps have much access to English
books. If you do you will find interesting views and
plans in Duff-Brown, Burgoyne, Champneys, and
Cotgreave; but they will hardly help you much, because
English methods are somewhat different from ours. Some
late plans for large libraries, given in “The Librarian,”
seem to show wasteful attempts at architectural effect.
Three things in the plans of small English libraries,
you will note, and should learn from—the clever
adaptation of irregular sites, the effective use of top-light,
and the economy of space in entrance halls.</p>

<p>In America there are plans in plenty. The most helpful
are the most recent.</p>

<p>Koch has over a hundred plans from all parts of the
country, including branches, most of them costing from
$10,000 to $50,000. But as yet he has no letter-press
to explain the plans.</p>

<p>Miss Marvin gives exterior and interior views and
floor plans, with full descriptions of twenty libraries,
costing from $2,600 up to $75,000. No one should plan
a library of any size without giving her pamphlet a
careful reading.</p>

<p>Eastman gives exteriors, interiors and floor plans of
twenty-five libraries, ranging in cost from $1,170 to
$80,000.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span></p>

<p>H. B. Adams has twenty-five exteriors, forty interiors and
only thirteen floor plans. Bostwick has seven floor plans.</p>

<p>The Massachusetts Public Library Commission Report
for 1899 shows one hundred and twenty exteriors, with
letter-press giving costs, but no interiors or floor plans.</p>

<p>The Boston Public Library Index to Plans of Library
Buildings, second edition 1899, refers to over twelve
hundred illustrations in various books, pamphlets and
periodicals, of which the largest number are only
exteriors, a few are interiors, one hundred and twenty
only are floor plans.</p>

<p>There are many exteriors of libraries, usually without
interiors or floor plans, published in popular and in architectural
periodicals, but very few of them furnish
valuable suggestions as to planning. Indeed much plan
hunting will rather daze than instruct an investigator.
A common defect in plans is the total absence of
information about the height of rooms—a vital measurement.
Indeed every plan should tell, both the height
of each story, floor to floor, and the height of each room,
floor to ceiling.</p>

<p>There are many interesting plans, with descriptions,
scattered among annual or special library reports, but
these have not been indexed together in any one place.
If one of the library-schools could compile as a thesis,
an index to plans of library buildings in books and magazines,
distinguishing between exteriors, interiors, floor
plans and letter-press information, and if someone like
Mr. Eastman or Miss Marvin could supply comments
as a guide through this mass of material, it would be a
good thing for the A. L. A. Publishing Board to father.
The A. L. A. itself once attempted to get a collection
of floor plans and got about a hundred sets as a start,
but I believe has never prepared any such card-index
of features, with such comments as would make them
valuable. I believe the Library Bureau has also a
considerable collection of plans.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span></p>

<h3 id="subhead-63">The Life of a Library Building</h3>

<p>This is a crucial question in problems of building. In
a recent discussion as to how much should be appropriated
a trustee soberly urged that the library should have the
finest, the most impressive, the most beautiful building
in town, and that it should be built solidly enough to
last hundreds of years, like the mediæval cathedrals.
But besides the question of first cost, how far can a town
afford to go in its expenditure for a library, while it has
schools to build, roads to improve, sewers to lay, parks
and playgrounds to develop? Besides this comes the
question whether it is wise to erect such barriers to
change as the walls and partitions of a too solid building
would offer.</p>

<p>Opinion of librarians is practically unanimous to the
effect that growth or change of methods will bring need
of alterations, additions, or entire rebuilding, in all
active libraries in less than a generation. Thus,—</p>

<p>“Librarians are among the most progressive of the
world’s workers and a library building, however well
arranged, may be out of date in a year or so.”—<i>Edward
B. Green.</i><a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<p>“You cannot foresee the future. Provide for ten
years” (in a small library).—<i>Miss Marvin.</i></p>

<p>“Estimate growth for twenty years.”—<i>Eastman.</i></p>

<p>“It is not only unnecessary but unwise to plan for
more than thirty years ahead, because library administration
may radically change.”<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span></p>

<p>“Twenty-five years will probably find your building
out of date, out of place, and a burden.”—<i>Dana.</i><a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p>“In England the Manchester library outgrew its building
in forty-three years; at Leeds, in twenty-three
years; at Glasgow, in twenty years; at Birmingham, in
thirty years.”—<i>Burg.</i><a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p>My own calculations have been made for twenty-five
years and I should call this the life of the average library
building. Unless in very stagnant institutions and
communities, there is sure to come, in much less than
that time, say in five or ten years, growth in books or
in use, requiring enlargement; again, equal growth in
the next five, or ten years. Then the enlargements become
entirely inadequate to new conditions or new
management, and by the time the building has been
occupied twenty-five years the trustees are fortunate if
they have so little money invested that they can afford
to pull it down and build a more modern building,
arranged according to the latest ideas for the latest
wants.</p>

<p>On the other hand an institution or a town may have
money given it by a donor who wants a handsome and
solid building. The question will then arise, “How compromise
between certainty of change, and desire for
permanence?” Why not in such case do what has been
suggested for college libraries—put up a fine façade, to
last a century or more, and use modern methods of
light construction for all behind it; thus combining
architectural effect with ease of alteration?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span></p>

<h3 id="subhead-64">The Time to Build</h3>

<p><b>Don’t Build too Soon.</b> All authorities warn against
building prematurely.</p>

<p>“It is a risky undertaking for a board to erect a
building in the first stage of their enterprise. Better
wait until its wants are developed in temporary
quarters.”—<i>Wm. F. Poole.</i><a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p>“Don’t build until you have the library, the librarian,
and the money.”—<i>J. C. Dana.</i><a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p>“Get your librarian, books, and methods first. Use
rented rooms until you know what you want. Almost
any rooms can be made to serve as a beginning, and can
be so planned that the fixtures and furniture are all
available for a new building. Experience will then teach
just the kind of building that is needed for that particular
town and library.”<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p><b>Alter Sparingly.</b> In a building given you already
occupied, make such not too expensive enlargements or
alterations as growth absolutely demands, but take a
long look ahead toward rebuilding. With the changes
in library methods developing so rapidly, a patched old
building soon becomes hopelessly out of date, and clogs
progress. Better save up money and cultivate opinion
in favor of building anew. Looking a generation ahead,
economy alone will demand, at some not distant time,
a building in which economy of time and service will be
possible. Do not go down to posterity in patched-up old
clothes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span></p>

<p><b>But Begin to Prepare Early.</b> As soon as your
librarian is selected, your books bought, and your
method started, it is never too early to think and talk
building. It will take a long time of fixed purpose to
work up to a gift or an appropriation. To canvass
merits of sites, to study precedents of management,
to calculate chances of development, to educate your
librarian, to watch and ask about architects, to pick out
deliberately the ideal building committee, will occupy
many interesting hours at board meetings and consume
months or years of preparation. While you are about
it, time so taken will allow you to accumulate a lot of
information, and to mature your judgment. If you
have your librarian get him to look up the files of the
library journals, and the annual reports of libraries of
your grade and class, and such as are rather ahead of
you, who have already realized what your future may
be. In these you will pick up here and there many
useful hints of experience. If you go to library club
meetings and talk with trustees and librarians with
similar problems to yours; if you take an occasional
leisurely jaunt to well-managed neighboring libraries, you
will absorb and be able to digest ideas which a hurried
search, after beginning to build, might not elicit just when
you want to use them.</p>

<p><b>And do not Put Off too Long.</b> But when you are
ready, go! Patient preparation has fitted all for wise
decision and prompt action. There is a psychological
moment at which public or donor may be carried by
storm, and the necessary funds can be secured. He
who hesitates then, is surely lost. When the money is
secured, and sufficient experience or advice has been
accumulated, the sooner you decide to begin to plan,
the better. Beginning to plan, however, is remote
from actual building. “Well lathered is half shaved”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
is a homely proverb, and the analogy holds in library
planning, even for the smallest building. Months to
formulate and fit together the first sketches, months to
work them out practically with the architect, many
conferences with the building committee, time after
decision to prepare working plans, time still to invite
and compare bids, then the slow processes of building,—there
is a deal of delay ahead after the decision is made
to build. You have just about got half through when
you finish these preliminaries.</p>

<p>The time to build is therefore when you are very sure
everything is ripe for action;—methods, preparation,
plans, enthusiasm, harmony, good advice, suitable agents,
sufficient funds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span></p>

<h3 id="subhead-65">Size and Cost</h3>

<p>At the outset either the cost must be estimated as
the first step toward getting an appropriation, a subscription,
or a donation; or the cost has already been provided
for, and the first step must be to see how large
a building it will allow.</p>

<p>In the former alternative, it is necessary to ascertain
how many books are to be provided for, how many
readers there may be in the several departments to be
covered by the work of that particular library, and how
large a staff can be afforded, with ample elbow room
for them all. The figures thus collected will enable an
expert to give the number of rooms and passages required,
with a maximum and minimum size, and a
tentative location of each room. By deciding on the
number of stories and the height of each, the architect
can then pack all into the least possible space and calculate
first the area of each floor and the cubic contents
and cost of an adequate building, to be verified by the
average cost of similar libraries in similar locations,
built under similar conditions. A rough but surprisingly
close estimate of the proper limit of cost may be reached
through reversing Carnegie’s stipulation for a pledge
of an annual ten per cent on cost for running expenses;
and taking ten times what the library costs a year to
run, or will take after completion. The result is testimony
to the wisdom of Mr. Carnegie’s library advisers.</p>

<p>In the latter alternative the librarian and architect
can at once get an approximation to a size which the
cost will allow by dividing the sum available by the
same <i>pro forma</i> cost per cubic foot. Having thus arrived<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
at the maximum of size, they can tentatively assume
the height and divide the cubic contents by it, to find
how many square feet can be afforded to a floor. After
this comes the puzzle how to get into this space the
proper collocation of all the rooms wanted, as large as
they ought to be.</p>

<p>See interesting calculation as to number of users to
be provided for in the different departments (in England,
not quite the same as ours) for towns of various
sizes, by Champneys,<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> quoting Duff-Brown. His tables
may suggest a basis of calculation here. See also
Duff-Brown in his own book.<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<p><b>The Cubic Cost.</b> This question is not difficult, if you
can reach a fairly exact standard for cost per cubic
foot. Of course this will vary with the material used,
and with the cost both of material and labor in different
localities. Various authorities quote it variously. In
the problems I have personally investigated, in eastern
New England, I have found that thirty-five cents cost per
cubic foot, for a simple warehouse-construction building,
including stack and furniture, was not too much to
allow. But Miss Marvin<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> says that in the Middle
West the building proper will cost from 11 to 14 cents
per cubic foot, or large solid buildings 20 to 25 cents,
plus 10 per cent of the total for fees, furniture and
finishing. As I always include these items in my calculations,
the estimates are not far apart.</p>

<p>Our English brethren are able to do somewhat better
if Champneys is correct—he ought to be, he is an
architect. He says, “As a general rule, 1s. per cubic
foot is probably about the right allowance in London,
if all fixtures are included, while 9d. or 10d., or less, is
sometimes sufficient in the provinces.”<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> Perhaps, however,
he does not include fees and furnishing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span></p>

<p>To calculate cubes, outside measurements of the walls
should be taken for the square area, and the height should
be measured from the floor of the basement to the roof,
or to half-way from eaves to ridge-pole, if the roof is
not flat.</p>

<p id="subhead-66"><b>Limiting Annual Outlay.</b> In planning remember
to watch not only first cost, but future expense
of running your library. The more expensive your
material, the larger its maintenance will probably be for
care and repair. The larger your halls and stairways,
the more diffuse your rooms, the farther departments
are separated, the more wasteful your heating
and lighting, the more your service will cost. Good planning
may easily save you ten per cent on first cost, and
twenty per cent every year for the life of the building—a
whole generation. Calculate this saving for yourself,
and be careful!</p>

<p>“It is impossible to have good administration without
a building properly planned,”—<i>The Libr. Asst.</i><a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>An architect generally overlooks those essentials which
may appear trivial, yet are of the greatest importance.—<i>Ibid.</i></p>

<p><b>Cutting Down Cost.</b> From the first a wise planner
will study to limit expense in every detail. After all
possible economy, however, the wants will so outrun the
possibilities, that when architect and librarian and
adviser have agreed on a plan and it has been accepted
by the building committee, the first experimental estimates
will go beyond the limit.</p>

<p>On what points will it be possible to cut down, without
serious sacrifice, from the library point of view?</p>

<p>In the first place, <i>size</i>. As cost is largely in proportion
to cubic contents, every cubic foot saved pares
down expense. It will generally be hard to spare<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
floor area anywhere, but there can often be reduction of
height in rooms or floors. The only real library requisites
of height are air-capacity, and reach of light from
windows across rooms. The architect often wants certain
heights for architectural effect,—but always try
to pin him down to what is actually necessary for comfort
in every room, and point out where mezzanine rooms
would serve in high stories.</p>

<p>In the next place comes ornament, exterior and interior.
In the John Hay library at Brown University,
several thousand dollars’ expense was saved by omitting
the cornice around the outside rear wall of the stack
room, without sacrifice of effect. In the Brookline cut-down,<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>
several thousand dollars were saved by omitting
two ornamental but superfluous gardens outside.</p>

<p>In a city, try to get the park department to assume
the cost of laying out the library grounds.</p>

<p>Then the entrance and halls and staircases, as originally
sketched, will be often found unnecessarily large
when tested by library requirements. At Brookline
the larger part of the saving was made on such extras.
Outside steps, platform, columns, cornices, balustrades
and the like, are often superfluous.</p>

<p>On material, again, much permissible saving can
be made. Inquiry of the architect will elicit that
less expensive material or finish will give as much
strength, durability and also as good effect as the
first choice.</p>

<p>“Shingles instead of slate, plain glass instead of plate
glass, cheaper brick, cheaper finish, omitting fireplaces,
using wood floors instead of tile.”—<i>Miss Marvin.</i><a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p>“Don’t waste money in too substantial construction
and <i>fireproofing</i>.”—<i>Stanley.</i><a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span></p>

<p>When the inquiry is made of him, the architect will
usually prove to be suggestive as to economies. He will
be much more interested in savings than in extravagance,
and he knows just where savings can be made
without real sacrifice of strength, utility, or beauty.
In fact, it is here and in suggestion of alternatives in
meeting library needs, that a practical architect will
often surprise the librarian.</p>

<p>Indeed, I have been surprised myself in finding how
keen an architect can be when this question comes up.
One would think he would hate not only to forego any
of his commission, but also to give up what seem to be
essential elements in a harmonious scheme. But in all
economies of this kind in which I have taken part, the
architect has thrown himself into problems of saving
with as much zeal as if he were to benefit rather than
the owner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span></p>

<h3 id="subhead-67">Open Access</h3>

<p>The admission of readers freely to the shelving, both
readers who want to select books to borrow for home-reading,
and those who wish to select from the shelves
books for serious reading in the building, has become a
common policy of libraries under the name of “open
access.”</p>

<p>For the benefit of borrowers of new books, popular books
or late fiction (in children’s rooms, children’s books),
open-access rooms are usually provided with wall or
floor shelving, or alcoves so widely spaced as to allow
free inspection of the books. Where there is not a separate
room or suite of rooms, there is a corner of the
light-reading room shelved for this use.</p>

<p>See “Carrels”<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> as to open access to the stack.</p>

<p>“Let the shelves be open, and the public admitted to
them. Give the people such liberty with their own
collection of books as the bookseller gives them with
his.”—<i>Dana.</i><a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p>This development of use has changed the problems of
planning in our generation more than any other new
idea, as will be realized in looking at floor-plans of any
of the old libraries.</p>

<p>The decision of the librarian and the trustees as to
what policy is to be adopted in all parts of the building
in relation to open access will largely govern planning of
all the departments. Even after a decision is given,
the question will arise, “Ought provision be made for
possible changes of method in future?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span></p>

<h3 id="subhead-68">Light, Warmth, Fresh Air</h3>

<p>After the library is finished, the staff will have to work
and the public to read in it.</p>

<p>The eyesight of everyone that enters the building
is dependent on the steady soft incidence, reflection,
diffusion, concentration, abundance, of natural and artificial
light supplied; their comfort summer and winter
depends on the amount of heat tempered or admitted;
the clearness of their brains, their ability to read and
comprehend depends on methods of ventilation; the
permanent health of all obliged to stay any length of
time in the library may be seriously affected by the
care or neglect of those who plan these vital elements
of construction. Better have the building plain, even
ugly, with these essentials perfect, than impressive and
elegant without them.</p>

<p>From the very first, in planning small or medium,
the large, or the largest libraries—in corridors, rooms,
hails, or stacks,—ponder these needs as you go on,
seek defects or merits in these directions as you visit
other buildings; set aside sufficient time for special and
deliberate study and review of these problems, librarian,
adviser and architect in solemn conclave, and resolve
to have your building, in these particulars at least, the
best one not only in your own state, but in America
and in the world.</p>

<p>As is elsewhere urged again and again, spend what
money you have to spare, in such essentials, rather
than in the luxuries of unnecessarily expensive material,
decoration, or furniture.</p>

<p>See special chapters, later on, on <a href="#subhead-104">Lighting</a>, <a href="#subhead-109">Heating,
and Ventilation</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span></p>

<h3 id="subhead-69">Faults to be Looked For</h3>

<p>In visiting other libraries or looking at other plans,
the virtues are sometimes hard to detect, but there are
some faults even a novice can see. For instance—</p>

<ul>
<li>Heaviness or embellishment of exterior, unsuited to a library.</li>
<li>Arched or pointed, mullioned or leaded windows, obstructive of light.</li>
<li>Domes, with rotundas beneath.</li>
<li>Columns and porticoes.</li>
<li>Overhanging roofs or cornices.</li>
<li>Stories, corridors, or rooms, unnecessarily high in the walls.</li>
<li>Waste of floor space.</li>
<li>Ornamental and excessively broad or massive stairways.</li>
<li>Stairs and corridors separating rooms which should adjoin.</li>
<li>Poor light anywhere; light in the eyes of readers instead of on the backs or pages of books.</li>
<li>Drafts, or absence of air.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are a few common faults; any good librarian
can suggest others from his or her own experience.</p>

<p>As the classes of library schools go about visiting libraries,
it would be well to have some expert instructor
or guide point out obvious faults of construction. The
local librarian could best show merits. Special reports or
theses on buildings would advance the cause of rational
planning among the coming generation of librarians.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span></p>

<h3 id="subhead-70">Frankness Among Librarians</h3>

<p>A certain amount of reticence among librarians in
talking about faults of their own buildings to visitors,
leads me to write this chapter. Whether it is due to
diffidence in posing as critics without enough experience,
or more likely to a spirit of loyalty to their institution,
I have not been able to determine. But certainly such
a spirit is disloyal to the cause of library science. No
progress can be made in building if every librarian must
act only on his own experience for his own building.
Every sensible man can see the good, the bad and the
indifferent among the tools put into his hands. Every
practical man can suggest corrections of faults, perfection
of the mediocre, even improvement of the good.
When a brother-librarian who is about to build comes to
ask advice and look over methods and means, the largest
loyalty is due to one’s profession and the public, and the
incumbent ought to give full benefit of his experience
and his opinion to the visitor, under the pledge of silence
if he wishes, but concealing nothing. His opinions may
be mistaken, his experience slender, but the very statement
will challenge the judgment of the inquirer and
enlarge the scope of his vision.</p>

<p>So the visitor in his turn, after going through his
planning, and occupying his new library, ought to pass
the methods he has selected, minutely in review, and
speak or write of them to visitors, at clubs, or in professional
periodicals, with like frankness. If he will be
candid about his own experience, a librarian who has
just built may be the wisest critic possible, and may
doubly help those who follow in his path.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span></p>

<p>He who has experimented with a new device or a new
method, if he tests thoroughly, impartially and sanely,
can be especially useful to his fellows by frankness in
reporting his praise or criticism.</p>

<p>Indeed, every experienced librarian who is also
ingenious, ought to try experiments as he has the
opportunity, not only in methods but in appliances.
A hundred bright minds, working in the same direction,
will be sure to hit upon new devices which will simplify
processes and better the building and furnishing of
years to come.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span></p>

<h3 id="subhead-71">Service and Supervision</h3>

<p>These are underlying elements of library planning
which only a librarian who has practised them thoroughly
understands. Even the “library architect” may fail to
grasp these on a new problem.</p>

<p>“Have the building convenient for both work and
supervision, where many a costly building fails. Have
all departments in harmonious relations, so as to serve
the public best, and at least cost in money, time, and
labor.”—<i>Eastman.</i><a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

<p><b>Service.</b> Short lines for every process are the essential.
There has been rather a tendency among architects
to imagine that modern contrivances can overcome space,
but every step, every motion, takes time; every step,
every motion saved, promotes efficient service, and
keeps the public waiting a second less. If you use
pages or “runners,” plan to shorten their runs. If you
use mechanical substitutes, speed them up, run them
on straight lines, avoid complications and corners.
Study every motion, every handling of a book in all the
processes of a library, and save a second here and a
second there. In sizable buildings, you will thus be
able to save not only minutes but often hours through
every work day of their future. “Many a mickle saves
a muckle,” is true of packing, passing, cataloguing,
handling, cleaning, collecting, distributing.</p>

<p>Do not be deceived by the suggestion that labor-saving
devices change principles. A yard is more than
a foot, by machine as well as by boy. Save time on
machines as on pages. Your needs will soon outrun
both.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span></p>

<p><b>Supervision.</b> “Helpfulness should be aimed at, rather
than supervision,” says Champneys,<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> and certainly it
should be aimed at <i>with</i> supervision. Accessibility to
helpless inquirers invites as well as facilitates easy
inquiries. But in America we find that supervision
deters as well as detects disorder, noise, mutilation,
theft.</p>

<p>Duff-Brown<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> calls attention to one aid not often
thought of,—the supervision of one reader over
another. This acts where students and serious readers
congregate, but somewhat fails in periodical and light-reading
and children’s rooms. There supervision is
more necessary.</p>

<p>In small libraries, supervision from the delivery desk
is all that is generally possible. It can be facilitated by
open floors, glass screens, avoidance of corners or projections,
and radial bookcases. In larger libraries, provision
for attendants at strategic points, such as corners
which command adjoining rooms, can be so arranged
as to help and supervise with minimum service. A
well-arranged desk for each attendant placed thus on
picket, will enable him or her to pursue any assigned
desk work, without interfering with supervision or
information.</p>

<p>Supervision of doors, entrance halls and stairways,
is most necessary;—in small libraries, from the desk; in
large libraries, through hall porters, who can also watch
art treasures and exhibition cases, as well as direct
visitors, and avert undesirables.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span></p>

<h3 id="subhead-72">Decoration: Ornament</h3>

<p>Ornament is the last thing to think of about a library.
Noticeable exterior ornament is not needed for dignity,
and conflicts with simplicity, two appropriate library
qualities. “Outside ornament is often vulgar,” says
Champneys.<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> Even statuary is not in keeping unless
the building has memorial purposes, for which additional
funds have been provided. Inside attempts at ornament
are often grotesque. Marble columns are out of place,
marble walls and staircases showy rather than sensible,
wall or ceiling frescoes distracting, floor inlays disconcerting.
If funds allow, such features and portraits in
vestibules, passage-ways and conversation rooms do
not interfere with reading or service. Portraits of
donors or deceased trustees or librarians may do in delivery-rooms
or light-reading rooms in which exigencies
of use require high enough walls and few enough windows
to leave available wall space. But in rooms for serious
reading, there should be no features of any kind to interfere
with reading or attract non-readers. Burgoyne
comments,<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> “In Boston, the decorative art makes the
public rooms art galleries instead of places for study.
The two objects are quite incompatible. The crowds
who gather to inspect the decorations are a nuisance
to the student who comes to study.” See also the
Report of the Examiners of the Boston Public Library
in 1895.</p>

<p>“In the reading rooms, ornament which attracts the
eye and creates interest, is a hindrance to the usefulness
of the rooms.”—<i>Beresford Pite.</i><a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span></p>

<p>“Interior decoration should be subordinated to the
use of the building.”—<i>Champneys.</i><a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<p>Isadore, Bishop of Seville<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> (A.D. 600) says that “The
best architects object to gilded ceilings in libraries, and
to any other marble than cipollino for the floor, because
the glitter of gold is hurtful to the eyes, while the green
of cipollino is restful to them.”</p>

<p>From this it appears that the architects of that age
were more considerate of readers than some in our own
generation.</p>

<p><b>Coloring.</b> I would draw a distinction between ornament
and decorous decoration. If as much attention
be given to the æsthetic influence as to the irradiating
and ophthalmic effects of shades of color on wall and
ceiling, the resulting beauty would at the same time
charm, soothe and satisfy all visitors. Sufficient study
is rarely ever given to this element of “Venustas.” In
one of my own early problems, I employed a young artist
who had a reputation as a colorist, to select tints for
different rooms, with a result which fully justified the
small fee he charged.</p>

<p>See four tints suggested at page 15 of the Boston
report, mentioned under “Light, Artificial.”<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> From
that report,<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> I quote:—</p>

<p>“For bright, sunny rooms a very light green is probably
the best shade.”</p>

<p>“For darker rooms, a light buff.”</p>

<p>“The ceiling should be white, or slightly tinted.”</p>

<p>“The woodwork should be of a light color such as
that of natural woods. <i>Under no circumstances</i> are
dark walls and woodwork permissible.”</p>

<p>(This applies to schoolrooms, but what applies to scholars
equally applies to readers in libraries, and these precepts
apply to furniture as well as to the other woodwork.)</p>

<p>Miss Marvin<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> suggests that,—</p>

<p>“Green, yellow, terra-cotta, light brown, and tan are
good.”</p>

<p>“No decoration is necessary except tinting.” [Excellent.]</p>

<p>“Corticene or burlap is good background for pictures.”</p>

<p>“Only one color is desirable for the interior of a small
library.”</p>

<p><b>Reflection of light.</b> Not only is color of walls and
ceiling a prime element in decoration, but it also plays
a large part in the cheerfulness and effectiveness of
diffused light, both natural and artificial; especially
in systems of indirect lighting. To select colors bright
enough to reflect, and soft enough not to dazzle, is one
of the nice problems of planning.</p>

<h3 id="subhead-73">Architectural Styles</h3>

<p>I dislike to stray upon the architect’s province, but
this subject affects planning so radically, that I will
venture to allude to it here, not as advice to architects
but as a warning to building committees. In many
conditions for competitions and in many discussions
among trustees where there happen to be amateurs in
architecture on the board, I see directions or hear suggestions
about this or that style. To formulate any
specific direction to the architect on this point at the
outset seems to me a fatal mistake. The style ought to
develop from the needs of the particular problem in
hand. Until the architect knows just what he has to
construct, to prescribe any conventional style only
cramps him. Neither practical libraries nor American
architecture can be developed by such swaddling clothes.
Select an architect who can be regarded as competent
and let him choose or create a style without lay dictation,
after he comprehends his whole problem. Remember,
you are not burying an old style; you are in
at the birth of a new one.</p>

<p>“The most noticeable thing about architectural styles
is the spontaneity of their growth, developing from the
obvious conditions of building.”—<i>Russell Sturgis.</i><a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p>“Having agreed on a good plan, you cannot properly
say to the architect, ‘We must have a classical building.’
It is the most difficult of all styles; formal symmetry
requiring exceptional skill in the architect.”—<i>W. A.
Otis.</i><a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span></p>

<p>Montgomery Schuyler writes, in his article on the
“United States,” for Sturgis’s Dictionary of Architecture,<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>
“For more than a generation, scarcely a public
building was erected which was not at least supposed
by its builders to be in the Grecian style. Nothing
could have been practically more inconvenient than the
requirement that one or more parts of a building divided
into offices should be darkened by the projecting portico.
In many cases this difficulty was sought to be obviated
by converting the central space into a rotunda,—a
wasteful arrangement.” Such is an architect’s comment
on a feature which has been the librarian’s <i>bête noir</i>.</p>

<p>To quote further from this interesting article:—</p>

<p>“The United States had thus nothing to show in
current building but copies of a pure and refined architecture,
implicated with dispositions entirely unsuitable
to almost all practical requirements.</p>

<p>“Even the most thoughtful of revivalists were apt to
take mediæval architecture as a more or less literal
model, rather than as a starting point for modern
work.</p>

<p>“The later graduates (of the French school) devoted
themselves, not to developing an architecture out of
American conditions, but to domesticating current
French work.”</p>

<p>(By the Chicago World’s Fair) “classic, in one or
another of its modes, was re-established as the most
eligible style for public buildings. No architect would
now think of submitting in competition a design for a
public building, in any other style than that officially
sanctioned in France.</p>

<p>“There is no longer any pretence of using the selected
style as a basis or point of departure to be modified and
developed in accordance with American needs and ways<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
of thinking, and with the introduction of new material
and new modes of construction.... In civic buildings
it may be said as a rule that there is no longer even an
aspiration toward a national architecture.”</p>

<p>After discussing at length modern commercial buildings,
Mr. Schuyler concludes with a sentence which may well
be applied to libraries: “Out of the satisfaction of commonplace
and general requirements may arise the
beginnings of a national architecture.”</p>

<p>Will there ever be evolved a distinctive library architecture?
I hardly think so. It will be possible to recognize
a library as you can now tell a schoolhouse; but
libraries if well planned will have more individualism,
I think, more characteristic charm, than the generality
of schoolhouses, but not a uniform architecture.</p>

<p>It is possible indeed that library loveliness will be
developed as a recognizable type.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span></p>

<h3 id="subhead-74">Amateurs Dangerous</h3>

<p>In looking back on the experience of thirty years,
I am inclined to think that most danger in library planning
lies in amateur interference. Not so much in amateur
librarians. When a trustee gets interested in library
methods he often graduates into the profession, and
becomes a leader. For instance, Justin Winsor, who
began as a trustee, became a librarian, and by vigorous
work did more to make his occupation a profession than
any other one American. Even when the trustee stops
short of this, he may sometimes worry his librarian by
half-knowledge and undue interference in administration,
but such a man is not apt to impede in building, for
his library zeal will move him to support the practical
side in any discussion.</p>

<p>But when a trustee (or, alas! a librarian) is an amateur
architect, one of those laymen who spend an English
vacation all in cathedral towns, and a French tour all
in the château district, he is apt to be troublesome, and
to want what he considers good style in architecture
rather than good methods of administration. If he is
put on the building committee, and it selects a too
artistic architect, one who magnifies “Venustas” unduly
at the cost of “Utilitas,” the library is doomed. Its
new building may be widely pictured in the magazines,
but it will not be so much used by readers, or praised
by librarians. Better modest ignorance, with common-sense,
than too much half-knowledge and pseudo-taste
in art or architecture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span></p>

<h3 id="subhead-75">Dry-rot Deadening</h3>

<p>One of the greatest dangers in building is dry-rot—not
in material or books, but human desiccation.</p>

<p>There is not much to fear from the architect. Unless
he is too much wedded to precedents and styles, he will
be progressive enough, under good advice. But a board
of trustees, often composed of elderly men, may be ultra-conservative,
remembering and clinging to the memory
of library methods and especially old styles of library
buildings, current when they were young. If they are
wise enough, however, to choose a building committee
of sane and open-minded men, whose recommendations,
founded on expert advice, they will listen to, these votaries
of tradition will not prove too obstructive.</p>

<p>After all, the real danger is from the local librarian
who has stopped growing. Just as there are children in
school who are bright scholars only up to a certain point,
where they seem to stop growing, there are men and
women librarians, very progressive at first, who come to
an age of suspended growth, and absolutely exclude
either new ideas or the comprehension of future development.
They may have served so well in the past,
or be so popular personally, or discharge many of their
functions so well, that they are retained in their positions
as librarians. They may still be useful in the
every-day service of the public, but such stunted progress
will utterly unfit them to act as building advisers,
who require a large view of the future. If you have
such a one as your local librarian, it is your first duty
to get him the best expert you can find to spur him up.
Unless the reactionary is also impracticable or jealous,
he may work well in harness with an adviser, by giving
full presentation of local needs.</p>

<h3 id="subhead-76">The Public</h3>

<p>The root of library opinion and support is public
sentiment. Indirectly, it nourishes the spirit which
inspires the private donor. Directly, it supplies the
impulse which founds the library; the enthusiasm which
supports it liberally; the civic wisdom and pride
which erect buildings; the large and democratic taste
which approves adequate facilities, sound construction,
quiet and appropriate beauty in building.</p>

<p>The aim in the United States is to make the library
an essential part of education, not only in acting with the
school system, but in carrying on the graduate to a
larger education at home, not only literary and social,
but industrial as well, so as to develop law-abiding and
useful citizens. There is a further aim, akin to that of
parks and playgrounds, in providing a sober recreation
to rival the attractions of saloons and street corners
and dance halls.</p>

<p>When the public can be convinced that its library
works to these ends and is economically and efficiently
managed, the community will support it generously.
When the time comes for building, sufficient funds can
generally be got without trouble. The voters will not
forget Washington’s injunction, “Promote, as objects of
primary importance, institutions for the general diffusion
of knowledge,” and they will rank the library first
among such institutions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span></p>

<p>“There is probably no mode of spending public money
which gives a more extraordinary and immediate return
in utility and innocent enjoyment.”—<i>Stanley
Jevons</i>, quoted by Crunden.</p>

<p>In library building, realize that the public, which
pays, should get every possible service in its best form,
service for educated and uneducated readers; for workmen
and workwomen, as well as for scholars, for the
children of all, and for the teachers of the children.
Especial thought should be given to those citizens who
can have no large libraries of their own. Your library
should be made so simple and homelike that it will invite
them as a home or a club they own.</p>

<p><b>Wise Election of Trustees.</b> The town can begin
to provide for wise building by paying some attention
to selecting suitable trustees. The position is an
honorary one in most towns, and is usually given to
clergymen, lawyers, men of literary taste, each of whom
is, as it were, citizen emeritus, retired from active
life, and remote from the wants of the public. The
board is apt to become a cosy club, and to get into a rut.
Especially is this so if it is in-breeding; allowed to select
its own members, and to become a clique. If Harvard
College cannot allow its overseers to serve more than two
terms successively, towns should not allow any town
board to become perpetual. Especially may this autocracy
work harm in building. Men chosen for literary
taste are not always the most practical. There ought
to be on the board of trustees representatives of every
section and every large element in the town. Among
them there should be enough wise, level-headed men to
make up a building committee, just the kind of men who
would naturally be selected as building committee of a
bank or church, men of judicial temperament who can
weigh the argument of librarian and architect, and of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
sober judgment to curb extravagance in either. It is
the part of the public to elect such men, and to defer
to their judgment when selected. Literary taste is
not needed on building committees. The librarian
ought to know how to handle books; his judgment
will suffice. Artistic taste is not needed; a good architect
ought to have that in his training.</p>

<p><b>Judgment.</b> In one final point the public can help
good planning; in their expression of opinion, their
criticism or approbation of the building after completion.</p>

<p>Even the stranger who flashes through the town in
his automobile can carry away into his own community
an intelligent lesson. If the building has been properly
planned, he should say, “That is evidently a library, a
good library; just suited to this town (or institution),
and evidently doing good work here.”</p>

<p>The citizen of the town should criticize its exterior
not so much for splendor as for appropriateness and
good taste. Does it suggest to him, and invite him to,
the study of books or the recreation of reading? Even
then, better suspend judgment until he sees or hears
how the new library works as a library. If he can educate
himself to this degree, his lay comment will have
some share in the progress of library science.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span></p>

<h3 id="subhead-77">Place of the Library Among Buildings</h3>

<p>A great deal of doubt prevails in communities as to
just how much money they are justified in putting into
a library building. In some towns, a disposition is
shown by local economists, to give it a low relative position.
They will grant liberal appropriations for a
florid town hall, for a large high school, for a commodious
grammar or primary school, for a handsome
headquarters for the fire department, even for a granite
police station, but they hesitate at a roomy building
for the public library. This is a narrow way to look
at it, for many more residents are served and largely
served by a library of the modern active type, than by
any one school or other institution. It has often been
said forcibly, that the library should rank just ahead of
the high school, and have a better building and better
support.</p>

<p><b>Site.</b> Though the choice of the site falls to the
trustees, liberality in buying it and public spirit in offering
sites at a low price, are incumbent on citizens, as well as
discouragement of squabbles arising from desire to benefit
real estate in different localities. A large charity should
be extended to the trustees, under their perplexities,
and a ready confirmation of their choice.</p>

<p><b>Ornament.</b> There is often an opinion in the community,
perhaps even among the trustees, in favor of
more solid construction or more ornamental features than
are necessary or appropriate in a public library building.
This should be stoutly contested by the more sensible citizens,
on the ground that a library is no more the object<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
of unnecessary expense or elaboration, than a schoolhouse.
It is a fairly well settled idea that schoolhouses
should not be extravagant, on the ground both of economy
and good taste. It should not be hard to persuade
a community to the same conviction as to libraries.
If, however, the opinion is obstinate, the suggestion
might be made that a sum be appropriated sufficient to
provide an ample but simple library building, and then
offer a vote of an additional sum for architectural elaboration.
This would bring the question squarely before the
people.</p>

<p>The trustees ought to be left to work out their own
problem first and ask for the necessary funds. If their
request seems proper, and the trustees have the confidence
of the public, the funds should be promptly voted.
If not, a committee which has the confidence of the
public can be appointed to report, but when they report
the trustees should be left to plan the library. They
will have to run it. If they still lack your confidence,
change them at the next election.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span></p>

<h3 id="subhead-78">The Donor</h3>

<p>More striking even than the library movement itself,
and than public liberality toward libraries, are the constant
and generous gifts of private citizens, not only to
their native towns, and as memorials to friends, but
even to needy communities alien to the giver.</p>

<p>“The most wonderful phenomena in American social
development.”—<i>H. B. Adams.</i><a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<p>Of these donors Andrew Carnegie has been the chief
and the exemplar. His generosity has been wise,
helpful, discriminating. He has avoided pauperizing
his beneficiaries and has stipulated that they also
help themselves, sometimes in building, always in
supporting. He has carefully apportioned his gifts
to the size and needs of each institution or community.
Most other donors have followed his example,
and the library movement has been judiciously
forwarded by these public-spirited friends. Of the
buildings reported in the Massachusetts 1899 Report,
103 were gifts (10 old buildings, 93 new) from private
donors, and 19 more part public, part private. It is
not always possible to praise the libraries they have
built; it is wise sometimes to ignore their motives; but
the wisdom of their intentions deserves high praise and
lavish gratitude. This generosity has not been confined
to America. Edwards<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> notes that out of 180 special
libraries he enumerates from all countries, 164 were
gifts. Fletcher<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> listed 60 such gifts in America when he
wrote, without counting Carnegie. The best gifts are
those which give a sum for building and another for books<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
and care. Thus John Jacob Astor<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> left to the Astor
library, $175,000 for a building, $120,000 for books, and
$205,000, the interest to go to maintenance.</p>

<p>This tide of benefactions may last even through the
generation which will follow Carnegie and his fellows,
and will doubtless parallel the progress of public building
for many years to come.</p>

<p>All donors, however, have not been as wise. Some
of them have overweighted quiet communities with
grotesque piles. Some of them have impoverished poor
communities by expensive piles without endowment.</p>

<p>“There is a small library building in a Connecticut
town, designed on a lavish classical scale. Its centre is
formed by a large, round and empty vestibule fit rather
to receive a swimming tank than a delivery desk. A
beautiful dome covers this vestibule, and makes the
exterior look like a mortuary chapel. Such a mistake
has cost $300,000, besides the expense of administration.”—<i>O.
Bluemner.</i><a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>

<p>But this bizarre feature was not all the architect’s fault,
it was mainly the donor’s. A prominent architect told me
that this commission was first given to him. He studied
the needs of the town, and its characteristics, and
following his instructions not to spare cost, he designed
as fine a library as he thought would suit and serve
such a place. On taking his sketch to the donor, he
was met with the contemptuous speech. “If that is the
finest library you can get up, I will find an architect
who can do better.” And he did. “Thus,” said my
friend, “I learned a lesson not to cut down my fee by
being too conscientious.”</p>

<p>The worst mistake a donor can make is to give the
building of the library to some protegé, or favorite
architect, without engaging a library expert to advise<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
him. There is one prominent university where all the
buildings are useful and beautiful but one. This a
donor gave, but got a young friend to design it in New
York, without seeing the site, or consulting the professors
in charge. The result is a blot and a shame.</p>

<p><b>A Library no Taj Mahal.</b> If any millionaire sees
this whose affection for a lost friend leads him to build a
library as a memorial, let me earnestly beg him to
make his building very modest and practical,—with a
commensurate endowment, if he will. But if he wants
to build a beautiful tomb, as he has a right to do, let
him select some other more appropriate form. A library,
of all institutions, is alive and always busy. The work
it can do might be a lasting memorial to a lovely and
useful character, but not if it is smothered and deadened
by an architectural snuffer. I would suggest that a fine
gift to a small town would be a group of buildings, say
a town hall, a library and a high school, the three
separate but connected by arcades, a noble but not
oppressively grand and out-of-place trio; each simple
and perfect for its use and place.</p>

<p>The library, properly criticised by Mr. Bluemner,
cost $300,000. The town in which it is situated had
at the time its library was given, about 4,000 population.
In looking over the list of Carnegie gifts, I note that a
town of 6,000 was allotted $15,000 as his idea of a suitable
building for so small a place. Twenty libraries of
this size could be built for the cost of the Connecticut
misfit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span></p>

<h3 id="subhead-79">The Institution</h3>

<p>Any library owned by an institution and not by the
public, ought to have as good and as thorough advice
as it can get from the wisest and most experienced
librarians of similar institutions, which its own librarian
or any expert will know how to elicit. It will be fortunate
if it can secure as its own expert, some such librarian
who has recently gone through the whole experience of
building.</p>

<p>The officers of the institution should define beforehand,
just what scope its library is to cover; just
how it is to serve members, special students and visitors;
how much money will be required for suitable
building and thorough equipment; where enough money
is to come from; what site (if site is not already chosen)
is most central for probable readers and will lend itself
most readily to the purposes of the association.</p>

<p>If its library is sufficiently large for a suite of rooms,
but not large enough to demand a separate building, its
trustees and architects should devote to the library,
if possible, a separate floor or a separate wing or special
ell, with provisions for differentiation, change, and
growth, and should so locate other departments that
are most closely affiliated with the library, in the closest
juxtaposition.</p>

<p>Indeed, where the library has begun to be important,
rooms need expert advice in location and details almost
as much as the building. But when it has attained the
dignity of separate housing, all that is said elsewhere
about expert advice applies with double force to a highly
specialized institution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span></p>

<h3 id="subhead-80">The Trustees</h3>

<p>To the trustees falls full and final responsibility for
all library building. They formulate the needs of the
library, get the funds from the proper body, choose
the site, elect the librarian, and select the architect.
After hearing the librarian and architect, they decide
on all its exterior and interior features. With them
should really rest either praise or blame for the result.
Unlike the librarian and architect, they serve without
stipend. They deserve every consideration and full
support.</p>

<p>But not every trustee is an archangel. Boards of
trustees may harbor many faddists, many cranks,
many busy-bodies. How to head these off from meddling
with building is a problem in tact. There is often a
member who “knows it all,” and cannot be moved by
any expert advice. He is just the man who wants to
take control. He is dangerous.</p>

<p>“More buildings are spoiled by clients than by architects.”—<i>E.
B. Green.</i><a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> And this kind of trustee is the
client who is most apt to spoil the library.</p>

<p>“The trustee will be careful not to consider himself an
expert.”—<i>Dr. Jas. H. Canfield.</i><a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> But if there is a sane
majority who realize the seriousness and extent of their
task, they can at least select their sanest three to serve
as a building committee, delegating to them details of
investigation, reserving to the full board only important
points reported by the committee.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span></p>

<p>In small communities the trustees will probably be
men of greater experience in affairs than their librarian,
and better able to make investigations than he. They
will also be better able to deal with the architect,
and to judge the soundness of his advice. As the
library is larger, large enough to have a mature and
trained librarian, the board need not take an active part
but may be content to serve as a court of appeal.</p>

<p>Experience of the past has shown that there are two
prevalent dangers: <i>first</i>, the idea that the board has a
primary function to make their building an ornament to
the town or institution; <i>second</i>, the delusion of some
member that a little dabbling in architecture or building
has made him competent to advise the architect.</p>

<p>If a library can be made both practical and beautiful
within the appropriation by expert advice, free from amateur
experience, it is enough for the trustees to take
pride in, that they have furnished wise guidance to such
a happy result. Interference with technical details on
their part is very unwise. The board should realize
that they are trustees of the library, not an Art Commission,
and that the special trust committed to them,
the trust to which they must be true, is the use of books,
not the abuse of architecture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span></p>

<h3 id="subhead-81">The Building Committee</h3>

<p>Pick out the building committee very carefully, for
fitness, not out of courtesy, or because certain members
want to serve on it.</p>

<p>A judicial disposition, common sense, an open mind,
are necessary; for they have to consult and instruct
the architect and the library expert, to ratify their recommendations
and decide where they differ.</p>

<p>The constitution of this committee is really the crux
of building. On their judgment rests the event of success
or failure in planning. Their chief duty is to weigh
the advice of experts.</p>

<p>“The Building Committee usually has very vague
ideas [at first] about size, location or requirements.”—<i>Bluemner.</i><a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

<p>Once constituted, this committee should relieve the
board of minutiæ of planning. If they are wise, they
will throw the burden of all inquiry, inspection and
initial steps on librarian and architect. If these agree,
the committee may take steps to verify their conclusion,
but need not be themselves active. Their function
is like that of a “struck jury,” to report from time to
time to the full board for ratification of their decisions.
Perhaps their most difficult function will be to curb the
architect in expense and unnecessary ornament.</p>

<p>They will have all they ought to try to do, in deciding
various questions which will arise in planning, and
in their services as umpires they can earn the thanks
of their fellow-citizens.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span></p>

<h3 id="subhead-82">Free Advice</h3>

<p>If you hesitate to pay money for an expert to give
special study to all your problems of planning, you
can get good advice from many sources in driblets. In
the first place, your librarian will naturally contribute
all he knows without extra charge. In England, Duff-Brown
suggests that at the outset candidates for librarianship
should be asked, “Do you possess any practical
knowledge of library planning?”<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> This qualification is
not often considered in America; and the ordinary
library education and experience do not develop it.
But your librarian may happen to have served through
building problems in some previous position. If such
an expert has thus been fortunately secured in advance,
his advice will be freely given. Even if
not, any fairly good librarian ought to know where
to look in books for information, and to gradually
formulate his ideas, to be put into such brief and
pointed queries as he is justified in propounding to other
librarians.</p>

<p>If you have a state library commission, you are
allowed to ask counsel from them. In some states the
law provides that they shall give expert advice on
building, when asked for it. In all states such a custom
prevails. If there is no commission in your state, the
commission of a neighboring state would doubtless be
glad to advise.</p>

<p>To good librarians everywhere, even to those who
have become paid experts, you can always look for such
gratuitous consideration as does not make too much<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
demand on their time. Their experience and judgment
will be generously given free. “If there be any profession
in which there is community of ideas,” says Miss
Plummer, “it is that of librarianship.”<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> But always
remember that librarians whose advice is worth asking,
are very busy with the work of their own libraries.</p>

<p>“Information <i>on specific points</i> is freely given by librarians,
but in the midst of pressing official duties it is
often a severe tax on their time. It is also impossible,
in the brief space of such a reply, and without learning
the resources at command, to give much useful
information.”—<i>W. F. Poole.</i><a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

<p>Boil down your queries, into pointed questions which
can be briefly answered. Draw them off in a list, with
spaces for answers, which can be filled in and returned
without labor of copying, and enclose a stamped return
envelope. So will you not “ride a free horse to death,”
and will preserve your adviser fresh for further usefulness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span></p>

<h3>But be Sure to Get Good Advice</h3>

<p>Either from your own librarian or his friends, or from
a library commission, get thorough advice and special
study for every point in every department as you plan,
and before allowing any exterior features to be settled.
Do not put too heavy a burden of responsibility on the
architect.</p>

<p>“He should not be expected to furnish the idea
of the building. Its planning is a separate problem
to be solved. It is the business of the owner, not of the
architect, to decide this.”—<i>Patton.</i><a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<p>“Do not rely entirely on an architect, however great
his artistic and technical qualifications.”<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>—<i>Duff-Brown.</i></p>

<p>“Most of the unsuitable buildings are due to unstated
problems. Too much of the lay trustee, <i>too much of the
librarian himself sometimes</i>, who thought he knew, but
didn’t, have been the causes.”—<i>B. R. Green.</i><a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

<p>Indeed, rather than trust to incompetent library
advice or an inexperienced architect, I would suggest
going to the Library Bureau and giving them charge of
building. They would at least know where to go for
competent advice, and would not charge any more
profit on what they expended than experts deserve.
So thinks B. R. Green.<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>

<p>“Many librarians are burdened with repeated calls
for information which more properly ought to be obtained
from an independent expert.”—<i>H. J. Carr.</i><a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span></p>

<p>But, remember, in getting such advice from busy
librarians, you are getting only their opinions, founded
on experience and impressions, but not on careful and
minute study of conditions involved in your problem,
to which they cannot afford to give due consideration.</p>

<p>The fable of the lawyer is here germane, who, when
reproached by a friend, “That advice you gave me was
worth nothing, absolutely nothing,” replied, “Well,
isn’t that just what you paid me for it?”</p>

<p>The off-hand answer of a librarian, even an expert,
may or may not fit the case. He is certainly not to be
blamed if it does not fit, unless he has been duly retained,
and has taken time for mature study of all the
facts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span></p>

<h3 id="subhead-83">The Local Librarian as Expert</h3>

<p>“No plan should be drawn up or accepted without the
skilled guidance of a thoroughly trained expert.”—<i>Duff-Brown.</i><a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<p>Is your own librarian such an expert? It is assumed
that you have one, for some sort of a librarian is a prerequisite
of even a rudimentary library.</p>

<p>“First appoint your librarian: the rapid growth of
library interests has necessitated expert service in a
multitude of essential details.”—<i>Professor Todd.</i><a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

<p>“Should be a scholar and a person of executive ability,
versed in all departments.”—<i>Fletcher.</i><a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>

<p>The local librarian is undoubtedly expert in most
processes of librarianship, but is he or she such an expert—not
theorist, but expert—in building, that other
librarians look up to him for expert advice on that
subject? If not, does not your problem deserve the
advice of some librarian in whom others have confidence?
Do you not need the best advice you can get?</p>

<p>Has your librarian the natural aptitude for planning,
which would have made him a good architect?</p>

<p>Has he the presence and force which would lend
weight to his opinions against a positive architect?</p>

<p>“Has he a mind broad enough to argue on equal
terms with an experienced architect?”—<i>Mauran.</i><a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span></p>

<p>Should you consider him “a capable man of business,”
as Mr. Hallam suggested thirty-two years ago?</p>

<p>Is he too young to teach, or too old to learn?</p>

<p>“A very good librarian may yet have no great fitness
for the task of planning a building.”—<i>Miss West</i> (<i>now
Mrs. Elmendorff</i>).<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

<p>And a junior librarian need not feel hurt if he is not
trusted as an expert. As the best English authority<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>
says: “Do not expect too much from a low-priced
librarian.” To this I should add, “Do not expect too
much of any librarian, even a leader in the profession,
and do not expect omniscience of leaders.”</p>

<p>And it is, of course, superfluous advice not to take
your local librarian at his own valuation. He is most
likely to assume the function of an expert in building
when he is least fitted. The really experienced librarian
is apt to be modest and to ask assistance, in the belief
that “two heads are better than one.” It will not be
difficult, through a little quiet inquiry, to find where
you can get the best advice, at home or elsewhere.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span></p>

<h3 id="subhead-84">The Library Adviser</h3>

<p>“No library board should attempt building without
taking counsel of someone who has made the subject a
special study, and has had experience in library management.”—<i>Poole.</i><a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<p>If you want to get a really good library, which can be
worked easily, economically and effectively for years to
come, and if you are not quite satisfied to leave the
entire responsibility to the librarian you happen to
have, or the architect you happen to get, there is a chance
for you to employ, for a far less sum than a competition
would cost, such a library expert as will be able to give
you aid just where and when everyone may need it
most; an adviser who can limit expense of construction,
augment capacity, provide for the best and cheapest
service, explain your needs to the architect, avoid friction,
and bring to the best issue the countless puzzling
queries which will arise after the plans are settled, the
contracts let, and you plunge into the pitfalls of building
and furnishing. Contract with this adviser for the
whole problem, from start to finish,—you will want
him to appeal to, up to the very end, and it is poor
economy to try to scrimp on trifles.</p>

<p>“Committees who work without a trained adviser are
certain to spend many times more ... in futile and
expensive experiments.... No plan should be drawn
up or accepted without the skilled guidance of a thoroughly
trained librarian.”—<i>Duff-Brown.</i><a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span></p>

<p>“In this era of the establishment of so many new
libraries, and the gift of so many hundreds of buildings,
there is decided need for the effective service of a consulting
librarian. Many serious mistakes are made,
especially in building, for want of a competent professional
adviser.”—<i>H. J. Carr.</i><a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

<p>As two or more counsel are often called in to the
trial of a case at law, the importance of library planning
demands strong reinforcements for the local librarian.
An architect, usually a mature man of affairs, experienced
not only in building, but also with men, should be met
with equally experienced library advice, lest the library
side be overborne. Experience will respect experience,
but hesitate to yield to half-knowledge.</p>

<p>It will be possible to get such aid in any part of the
country. I should say that there are at least fifty able
librarians in the United States who have had such
experience in building as would qualify them as experts.
Their names could be learned from any library commission,
or from any good librarian. “Authoritative
recognition of experience and learning stamps a man as
trustworthy.”—(<i>Libr. Asso. Record.</i>) Few, perhaps,
have worked through all the problems of a very large
library. Many have built libraries or branches in the
other grades. In the branches, large librarians have
faced the requirements of small libraries and would be
competent advisers for any grade. The experts in any
particular class (except public libraries) are fewer, but
could be easily found. With demand, experts will
multiply. No new library need lack a suitable adviser,
if the local librarian will ask for one, and trustees can
see their way to employ him.</p>

<p>As to the fee, the need is so new, that no professional
scale has been prescribed. But for service from start to
finish, as I have recommended, one per cent on the total<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
cost would not seem too large for the time demanded,
the services rendered, and the ends gained.</p>

<p>(To compare library advisers’ fees with architects:
The American Institute of Architects have set as a
minimum fee, six per cent on the total cost of the building.
For preliminary studies alone, one fifth of this fee
is to be charged. This would be over one per cent.
The library adviser has very little to do with structural
planning or construction. His work corresponds fairly
well with “preparing preliminary plans,” so that one
per cent would seem to be a fair fee to offer. If he is
competent he can save ten times this by pointing out
better methods and practical economies.)</p>

<p>It will be always an open question whether the expert,
when chosen, can spare and be granted time from his
duties in his own library. His board, however, would
usually feel moved by courtesy to grant such time as
he needed, beyond his free evenings and holidays.</p>

<p>Briefer consultations would merit special fees, to be
agreed upon. In view of the expert character of the service
they should be as liberal as can be afforded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span></p>

<h3 id="subhead-85">Selecting an Architect</h3>

<p>In some states or cities, laws or public conditions may
compel competition, and even where there is no such
necessity, solicitation, especially from relatives and
friends, makes a direct choice embarrassing. But trustees
who have the courage, as they have the clear
right, to make a choice, will certainly save money,
gain time, be sure of a good working library and of an
appropriate and pleasing exterior, and stand a better
chance of pleasing everyone, by letting librarian, architect
and building committee get to work at the plans
as soon as the site has been chosen.</p>

<p>So when you have got a good librarian as a champion,
the next step is to get an architect. You need one—</p>

<ul>
<li>To advise on site;</li>
<li>To help plan the interior;</li>
<li>To consider material and construction;</li>
<li>To design the exterior;</li>
<li>To draw working plans;</li>
<li>To invite bids;</li>
<li>To prepare and let the contract;</li>
<li>To superintend construction.</li>
</ul>

<p>For this you must have on such an important and technical
building as a library, thorough professional education,
experience in designing and building, knowledge
of men; and of course, intelligence, tact, tractability,
ingenuity, sagacity, and honesty.</p>

<p>Consider all these qualities in your choice. If your
library is beyond the small stage, and especially if you
have secured an expert library adviser, you do not so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
much need an architect who has built libraries. You
do not need him for library advice as much as for the
duties scheduled above. He needs advice about the
special requirements of this problem. Possibly previous
ill-advised experience might leave him stubborn in bad
ways.</p>

<p>“If it be practicable to engage an architect at the
outset, it is the better course,” and remember, “The
most competent architect is not likely to seek employment
most aggressively.”—<i>Bernard R. Green.</i><a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p>

<p>“It is best to select the architect before the site is
selected. His advice will be useful. Commissions or
librarians who have built can suggest one.”—<i>Miss
Marvin.</i><a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

<p>But the most important question in regard to an
architect is, does he belong to the school which exaggerates
<i>Venustas</i> in all building, or the better school
which accepts <i>Utilitas</i> as the key to library problems?</p>

<p>I heard President Faunce of Brown at a building
committee meeting ask of the architect whom they
were “sizing up,” this question: “Do you believe in
planning the exterior or the interior first?” The answer
came, prompt and decided, “I want the interior fully
planned first; in no other way can I evolve appropriate
architecture.” A year later, at another meeting, President
Faunce asked the architect, “How are you satisfied
with your library, now that you see it built?”
“Very well,” was the answer. “I ought to be, because I
have never had a problem so thoroughly presented.”</p>

<p>A similar question ought to be asked every architect
before finally engaging him. If he wants to plan the
exterior first, he belongs to the class of architects who
ought to plan tombs, not libraries. Reject him, however
famous or influential or persistent he or his friends
may be.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span></p>

<p><b>Base of choice.</b> It is wise, in the first place, to
disregard pressure. The best architects will rarely try
to use it, or allow it to be used for them. A dignified
letter, with reference to work they have done, will
be all they would allow. Distrust activity in application.</p>

<p>“Announcement brings letters of solicitation from
architects or their friends, and all sorts of intrigues.
In private work, it is usual to appoint the architect
outright.”<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<p>If you have a satisfactory expert as a librarian or
adviser, any architect who has done good work will do,
even if he has had no direct experience with libraries.</p>

<p>“The number of libraries an architect has built makes
little difference.”—<i>Marvin.</i><a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

<p>Prominence, though, is not necessary. A good
authority already quoted, says: “The best of architects,
standing at the head of their profession, have
failed in practical library designing, some of them to a
ridiculous degree.”<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> We all could point out such men.</p>

<p>Get an energetic, young architect for a small library;
the large firm must turn over details to a subordinate.</p>

<p>“A local architect, if competent, may be better than
one at a distance.”—<i>Bostwick.</i><a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

<p>If you think it best to try to save on a library adviser
and yet do not fully trust the experience or the persuasiveness
of your own librarian, it will probably be
best, especially in small buildings, to find an architect
who has already built satisfactory libraries, and who
ought to know at least how to avoid bad blunders.
But here again do not take his unsupported testimony to
his experience. Make private and careful inquiry of
the librarians he has worked with, and those librarians
who have had to operate his buildings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span></p>

<p>“Look around, inquire about different men; make
inquiries from those who have worked with each. Select
him before he has been allowed to make a single stroke
of the pen on the plans. You will work with him much
better from the beginning.”—<i>W. A. Otis.</i><a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

<p>Choose the man, with a good reputation on his own
profession, who has shown willingness, reasonableness
and ingenuity in getting all requirements satisfactorily
packed inside a dignified exterior.</p>

<p>“Take a man willing to listen to the librarian’s point
of view.”—<i>W. R. Eastman.</i></p>

<p>It is not impossible to do this.</p>

<p>The American Institute of Architects, in their Circular
of Advice, says that “the profession calls for men of
the highest integrity, business capacity and artistic
ability. Motives, conduct and ability must command
respect and confidence.” This is the type of man who
will represent architecture in your contest. See that
the library champion is in the same class.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span></p>

<h3 id="subhead-86">A Word to the Architect</h3>

<p>Here seems to be a good place to slip in an aside to
any architect who chances on this book.</p>

<p>You will see that the keynote of the volume is belief
that the library is more akin to a workshop than to
Grant’s Tomb; perhaps akin to a literary workshop,
like a school, would be a more correct definition, and
you know how your profession grapples the schoolhouse
problem, I have seen many new schoolhouses
through the country, and have noticed how many of
them are simple but effectively beautiful. All librarians
believe that a perfect library inside, can be made
charming outside, through taste such as has been shown
in these schoolhouses. They ask architects to accept
their workshop theory rather than a monumental conception.</p>

<p>The building committee are your real clients, not the
librarian. To their decision you must bow, even if
you have to assume blame for a poor inside. But if
they give you a free hand and a library adviser, defer
to him. If he is not up to his job, if he is callow or
antiquated or faddy, be patient with him. With the
tact your profession knows how to exercise, interpret
what advice he tries to give, supplement his failings
with your own study of the subject, and plan the
best library possible under these circumstances. So
shall you win a crown of glory among librarians.</p>

<p>But if they give you a mature and wise adviser,
welcome him as a friend and lend ear to his experienced
advice. You will become a better architect in one branch
of your profession, he will broaden much in his, and
together you will advance both library science and
architecture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span></p>

<p>If you are altruistic, there can be no better opportunity
to serve the public than by curbing your artistic
ambition and devoting all your training and ability to
making this building a better library than has yet been
devised.</p>

<p>If you thus plan truly from inside outward, I will
predict that you will satisfy the public and yourself
far more than if you had thrust an unwilling library into
an inadequate shell, or had prostituted your genius by
forcing a false type of architecture on your helpless
clients.</p>

<p>As you must have gathered from glancing through
this book, I am a firm believer in the practical genius
and taste of the best American architects. I believe
that they can create consummate beauty out of the
most unpromising conditions, and I hope you will thus
grapple library problems.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span></p>

<h3 id="subhead-87">Which Should Prevail?</h3>

<p><b>The Building Committee</b> chooses site, appoints
adviser, selects architect, defines scope of the library,
is final arbiter of everything, with appeal to the full
board. Every point which remains in dispute after
conference among all the advisers, should be formulated
in definite questions, with clear reasons <i>pro</i> and <i>con</i>,
and submitted to the committee. Except in a very
small library, where one of the trustees is virtual director
in default of a skilled librarian, the building committee
can serve best by keeping their minds free for such
decision, if called for, on such presentation. The advocates,
if unanimous, should receive unanimous approval;
if divided, the committee must decide on the weight of
the arguments presented.</p>

<p><b>The local librarian</b> will have to run the library
after it is built, and if he has sufficient sense and experience
to know what he wants, he ought to have his choice
in any possible alternatives.</p>

<p><b>The library adviser</b>, as he has the wider range of
experience, should carry great weight with the local
librarian, the architect, and the committee. He can
often point out more than one satisfactory way to
reach a desired end. When he and the librarian agree
after discussion, as they generally will, the architect
should have very strong convictions before opposing
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span></p>

<p><b>The architect</b>, on points of construction, is supreme.
Neither librarian or adviser will want to oppose him
here, although both may be able to advise. When the
plan is fixed, they must confide to him its clothing in
architectural form, and its execution. During planning
it is wise to consult him at every step, for his training, his
experience, his genius, will improve on many ideas,
and will show ways of overcoming many obstacles.
Before he gets through, indeed, he will get to be very
much interested, and become something of an expert
himself in library science.</p>

<p>But the architect and librarian should not disagree.
When a point of difference arises, as it may, talk it
over amicably, patiently, thoroughly. The aim of all
should be, to build a good working library. When all
the reasons are presented (here is where the librarian
or library adviser should be a clear and persuasive
advocate), the architect may come to see the matter in
the same light. If not, he has got to present more
powerful arguments. Perhaps he can show the librarian
how he can gain his end in a more correct architectural
way. If they still disagree, each side will be
ready to present its reasons to the building committee,
with odds in favor of the librarian. Champneys (an
architect)<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> acknowledges that “architects should not
be considered competent arbiters on questions of library
administration.” But, if it is a structural question, or
a question of taste, the architect’s advice ought to be
preferred.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span></p>

<h3 id="subhead-88">Architectural Competitions</h3>

<p>As to libraries, the American authorities seem unanimously
opposed to competitions.</p>

<p>The American Institute of Architects at their 1911
convention, said: “The Institute is of the opinion that
competitions are in the main of no advantage to the
owner. It therefore recommends, except in cases in
which competition is unavoidable, an architect be employed
upon the sole basis of his fitness for the work.<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>”</p>

<p>“Sketches give no evidence that their author has the
matured artistic ability to fulfill their promise, or that
he has the technical knowledge necessary to control the
design of the highly complex structure and equipment
of a modern building, or that he has executive ability
for large affairs or the force to compel the proper execution
of contracts.</p>

<p>“I will add, that an architect’s established reputation
and the excellence of what he has already built, are far
better proofs of his ability to undertake a library, than
any guess he can make in a competition. Competition
descends into a guessing match as to what will please
the committee.<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>”</p>

<p>“The whole matter of employing professional men in
this way is absurd. The architect should be called in
at the very commencement of the work. His opinion
is as much needed in the choice of a site, and the first
formation of the owner’s ideas, as in the preparation of
working drawings.”—<i>Sturgis.</i><a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p>

<p>The practically unanimous opinions of architects and
librarians who have written or spoken on building, are
strongly against competition. In an excellent paper<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
read at the Waukesha Conference by an architect,
Mauran,<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> he said: “Appoint your architect. It is a
popular notion among laymen that a competition will
bring out ideas, but I know of only one building erected
from competitive plans, without modification. Aside
from the <i>needless expense and loss of time</i> entailed, a
greater evil lies in the well-proven fact that most architects
endeavor to find the board’s predilections.” (Instead
of trying to work out a perfect plan.)</p>

<p>“Avoid the competitive method.”—<i>E. N. Lamm.</i><a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

<p>“A plan that has nothing in its favor, and everything
against it.”<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

<p>“Of three methods, open competition, limited competition,
and direct choice by the board, the last is far the
simplest, and much less expensive.”—<i>Mrs. Elmendorf.</i><a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>

<p>“Trustees are not likely to get what they want by
competition.”—<i>W. R. Eastman.</i><a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

<p>“After the requirements have been sent out to competitors,
there can be no more consultations between
them and the librarian until the award is made.”<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> (This
cuts out the librarian just at the critical part of planning.)</p>

<p>“It is not usual or advisable for buildings costing less
than $75,000.”—<i>Marvin.</i><a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>

<p>Out of twenty-two libraries included by Miss Marvin
only two had competitions. One library<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> reports:
“It was the intention of the board to choose by competition,
but none of many plans submitted was satisfactory.
Committee finally decided on architect and
worked with him.”</p>

<p>“What little good there is in competitions is not to
the advantage of the client, but rather to the advantage
of the architect. The young men have a better chance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
to win, before their time. An architect directly selected
<i>grows up with the committee, educates them, and learns
from them</i>.”—<i>Edward B. Green.</i><a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></p>

<p>“The committee had thought of having an architectural
competition, but in deference to the advice of the
librarian and his adviser, they selected an architect
without competition, so that every step in planning,
from the outset, could be discussed from the standard
of the architect, as well as from that of the librarian.
To this is to be attributed the success of the building.”—<i>John
Hay Library Report.</i><a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>

<p>If any doubt remains, after reading these quotations,
I will add that all my study and experience for over
thirty years, in many hundred concrete cases, have led
me to the profound conviction that the surest way to
spoil and stifle a library is to invite an architectural
competition. I have so great confidence in the talent
and genius of American architects, that I believe any
one of them, true to the traditions of his profession,
would take the conditions presented by librarians, and
out of them, work up a library much more practical and
far more beautiful than could be ensured by any method
of competition.</p>

<p>If law, or public demand, or fear of assuming responsibility,
prevent a board of trustees from choosing an
architect at the outset, they should first choose an
architectural adviser (see next chapter), whom they
will have to pay handsomely, as well as to pay premiums
and prizes for the competition (I see that the University
of California laid aside $50,000 for this purpose);
and have him formulate the requirements, superintend
the competition, and assist in judging (“assessing”
it is called in England) the results.</p>

<p>But I wish that he might be able to shut out from any
award those competitors whose plans would exceed the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
prescribed cost. I remember in my callow days having
gone to a friend who was a prominent architect, and
proposing to prepare joint plans in a great library competition
then impending. He laughed and said, “Yes, I
would like to do it as a matter of study, but we will
not win a prize. Ours will doubtless be a fine library
inside, but there will be no librarian among the judges of
award. We will have a fine exterior, but we shall try
to keep within the desired cost. Some other architect
will plan a larger and more florid and more expensive
building, which will fascinate the public eye so much
it will win the prize, and the donor will be asked for more
money, which he will meekly contribute.” My friend
was right. Just this result followed.</p>

<p>In the recent Springfield (Mass.) competition, each
architect was required to submit with his plans an estimate
of their cubic contents, as a basis for calculating how
much they would cost. This was an excellent precaution
against just this danger.</p>

<p>In England a competition is apparently accepted as a
necessary evil.<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> I cannot find anything on the subject
in Burgoyne, but the architect Champneys<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> says that
the architect is in most cases selected by open competition.
He adds that this “gives openings to those whose
abilities would otherwise escape recognition,” and rather
faintly concedes some advantage in selection.</p>

<p>“It is almost impossible to make instructions (in a
competition) so comprehensive that an architect can be
taught this very special branch of his art.”—<i>Champneys.</i><a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></p>

<p>It should be also recognized that competitions are very
costly and delay work on a library several months.
What is saved by not having a competition would pay
ten times the expense of getting the very best library
expert.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span></p>

<h3 id="subhead-89">Judges of Competition</h3>

<p>The advising architect, necessary in case of a competition,
and often called in when another architect has
been selected for a very large problem, is generally
taken from among the heads of architectural departments
of universities or technical schools, though one
authority suggests that sometimes a prominent architect
in actual practice might be a more up-to-date judge.
As has been already said, he formulates and guides
the competition and acts as chairman of the jury to
award prizes. Sometimes more than one architect is
asked to serve on this jury, with unprofessional citizens
of artistic taste.</p>

<p>But very rarely is any prominent librarian, almost
never a considerable number of expert librarians, named
for the jury. Here, however, they ought to have
especial influence. They can at least prevent bad
blunders. As a librarian who had recently served on
such a jury confided to me, “All we could do,
of course, was to pick out the plans which had the
fewest faults from the library point of view.” The
least a board of trustees could do, it would seem, after
handicapping their library by a competition, would be
to let expert librarians have a large share in picking
out the plan. But perhaps they would want utility too
much, and the real object of a competition is only outside
show, of which the librarian is not a better judge than
the average man.</p>

<p>If the trustees wish above all to have a good working
library, they ought to ask to serve on the competition jury,
one prominent librarian who has built, and one prominent
librarian of some library of the grade and class which
is to be built, and give especial weight to their opinions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span></p>

<h3 id="subhead-90">Order of Work</h3>

<p>The building committee having been chosen, the librarian
being in charge, the adviser selected, the architect
appointed, the cost provided for, and the site chosen,
it is time for planning to begin.</p>

<p>The first step should be to inspect the site together,
and let the architect (without letting his mind anticipate
details) say what form of building would best suit
site and neighborhood,—tall or low, broad or narrow,
four equal-sided, or front and rear, occupying whole
lot, or leaving skirts for air, light, and quiet.</p>

<p>If the committee should approve his first impressions,
the next thing to do is for librarians to find the cubic
contents that funds will allow (see chapter on Cost<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>),
get from the architect his idea of how many stories
there would better be, with the height of each (including
basement), and possible pitch of roof. Then, getting
tentatively the height of the building, divide the cube
by the height, to approximate the floor area.</p>

<p>The next important question is, which shall be the
main floor? The second floor is sometimes considered;
if the ground falls off rapidly, what is basement on one
front, and ground floor on the other, may be eligible.
(In comparing English with American plans and descriptions,
remember that their first floor is our second.)
Almost invariably, the first or ground floor will assert
itself as the main floor, into which, in all buildings but
the largest, it will be desirable to dovetail as many
departments of active service as possible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span></p>

<p>Having already calculated the available area of the
floor, you are prepared to make a list of the rooms you
want to get on it, and to define the size of each. You
will already have arrived at some prepossessions about
this, but before you finish planning you will probably
have to modify them considerably. To be thorough, it
will be wise to make your own list of the rooms needed
for the kind and extent of work you want to do, then
look over a lot of plans, and perhaps read the printed
architectural requirements issued for libraries of your
grade and class, in order to be sure you have not overlooked
any of your own needs.</p>

<p>As you get to know the size of your delivery-room
and main reading-rooms, it is time to confer again with
the architect about his general ideas as to suitable proportions
for building, whether it will have a distinct
front and rear or will require outside effect all around;
and as an element in that case, where you shall put the
stack, if you have got to have one.</p>

<p>Then comes the most interesting part of planning,
the putting together of your picture puzzle. Mr. Foster
of Providence actually cut out of paper and grouped
together his proposed rooms. I have found it better
to get the architect, with paper, pencil and foot-rule,
and draw to scale many successive sketches of each
floor, assembling and transferring rooms, working out
the passages, and calculating stairs. As you proceed, the
architect will be evolving his exterior, and now, before he
gets his mind fixed, is the time for mutual concessions.</p>

<p>When the rooms are fairly co-ordinated, their required
furnishing has to be plotted in, especially the shelving.
How many books and readers, how related, do you want
in each room? Are wall-shelves better, or full floor
cases, shallow or deep alcoves, low floor cases, partitions,
railings, what not? Have you provided for full supervision
and quick service everywhere?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span></p>

<p>The stack requires separate study. Is it necessary
to have one? Where shall it best be put,—along one
side? at the top? at the bottom? or as a projection from
the building? As to details, see chapter on <a href="#subhead-141">Stack</a>.</p>

<p>When the rooms have been settled and their requirements
defined, the architect’s special duties begin. He
has to settle the necessary height of rooms, the provision
of sufficient light for each by day and by night,
the arranging provisions for heat and ventilation, not
to interfere with books or shelving, or tables or desks.
All this before the exterior is considered,—all spent
in planning that interior which the exterior must conform
to.</p>

<p>“Work on your plan, finish your plan. When that is
perfect, the rest will come.”—<i>Mauran.</i><a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></p>

<p>Then you may take a month or two for the preliminary
conferences between the librarian and his adviser; a
month or two for conferences between them and the
architect; a month or less for inspection of other libraries.
At some time during this process two trips may
be taken to other libraries, the first rather early, as soon
as your ideas have taken form enough for you to know
what you want to look at; the other toward the end,
when your need of further information is fully defined.
Where to go, whom to take on your tour of inspection,
will depend on what funds you can spare. Details of
furniture, location of lights, and so on, may be deferred,
to be taken up during building. A month or less is
needed to submit results to the committee. After their
approval has been obtained, the architect must prepare
working drawings and specifications, invite bids for
work, wait two or three weeks for them, and even then
you are ready to break ground on your building in half
the time and with half the expense, for fees, traveling,
and all, that a competition would have required.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span></p>

<p><b>Extras.</b> One good result of this thorough study of
every detail in advance should be, that no new wants
or serious omissions occur to you when you come to
build.</p>

<p>But if you do not plan so thoroughly as to cover all
contingencies, expect to find something to be changed
or added as you go on, confronting you with those
“extra charges” which often appall builders of dwelling
houses. Still if your oversights follow to plague you,
your architect can here help you with the contractor,
and can generally find savings enough in “perfectly
good” alternatives in labor or material to balance the
cost of the extras. If they finally get ahead of you,
and materially increase the cost, either architect or
librarian is at fault—someone did not plan well ahead.</p>

<p><b>Model.</b> The last step of planning may well be the
preparation by the architect of a sketch-model in clay
for the building committee. This shows the proportions
and visualizes all features far more clearly then
floor plans, elevations and sections on paper can do.
If the sketch-model can show both elevation and sections,
it will bring to the librarian his allocation of
rooms in final review, and bring out to all concerned,
librarian, architect, committee and public, just how the
building will “work” and how it will look.</p>

<h3 id="subhead-91">Site</h3>

<p>If the site is given by a donor, or chosen by some
other authority, and has been accepted by the board,
the only thing to do is to make the best of it. Adapt
your plan to it, improve whatever opportunities it may
offer, and overcome its defects as best you can.</p>

<p>If it is open to choice, there are often embarrassing
conditions. Owners of lots more or less eligible (usually
less) are anxious to unload at good prices, and besiege
the board with importunities; or owners of real estate
not immediately eligible, exert all their direct and
indirect influence to get the library building in their
district or on their “side.” Even after the choice has
been narrowed down to two or three acceptable lots,
and has been freed from “pull,” selection is difficult
because of different <i>pros</i> and <i>cons</i>.</p>

<p>The main consideration for central library or branch
is accessibility for the largest number of users. Retail
centers, not so much geographical as practical, well
served by car lines, point out the proper neighborhood,
but main streets are often too noisy, and good lots on
them are too expensive and not easy to get. If there
is a quiet street next back of, or close to a main street,
especially with an adjoining public square or small park,
it will furnish an ideal spot for a library. Good vistas
of approach afford opportunities for effect, and bring
the library into view and notice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span></p>

<p>Space all around the building, and adjoining streets
on as many sides as possible, give light, isolation from
dangers of fire, more quiet, less dust, than positions
directly on a main street.</p>

<p>A wholesale business section, whose occupants only
come during business hours of the day, is not a good
location. Edges of vast open spaces are not so good
as actual centres of residence or of small retail trade to
which residents are attracted.</p>

<p>If a site among high buildings must be chosen it would
seem wise to build the library high, with reading rooms
up toward air and light.</p>

<p>By all means try to foresee and provide for future
developments as they may affect immediate surroundings
and future accessibility. The neighborhood of
schools is always good. Bear in mind that certain
noisy or smoky occupations are bad neighbors, and
slums only suitable for charitable work.</p>

<p>A lot too high above the street grade may offer architectural
advantages, but is bad for public library purposes.
Popular departments ought to be directly at
street grade, and the necessity of climbing steps hinders
rather than attracts readers. A lot sloping upward
requires objectionable and expensive approaches, one
sloping sideways is unbalanced, but one sloping backwards
is often good, for it allows a light basement at the
rear, or a stack above and below the main floor at street
grade.</p>

<p>It goes without saying that a wet soil is to be avoided
where books are to be stored.</p>

<p>In a large city a favorite site for the central library
is on some municipal square, near other public buildings.
But in such a prominent place, especial care is necessary
to escape a heavy architectural style which would
darken the building, and divert cost from library facilities
to expensive material.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span></p>

<p>In smaller cities and towns, better sites in proportion
may be obtained. Here, where land is cheap enough
to allow more space, always provide for growth and
future extensions of the building. It has been advised
to get enough land for future development, even at
expense of the first building.</p>

<p>“The worst site is a deep one, of irregular shape, with
only one frontage. If offered, don’t buy, or even accept
it as a gift.”—<i>Burgoyne.</i><a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p>

<p>But a deep and irregular lot, with a possibility of light
on all sides, may not be unfavorable for a building with
a stack at the rear. Narrowness in a stack, if somewhat
unfavorable to short lines of communication with the
desk, give possibilities of excellent daylight everywhere.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span></p>

<h3 id="subhead-92">Provisions for Growth and Change</h3>

<p>It cannot be too strongly urged that a chief caution
in planning should be to anticipate and provide for that
rapid growth which may strike any American community,
large or small, urban or rural; and that development
or change of methods which will come even if
there is no growth of population. When or how or
just where it will come, it is always difficult to foresee.
The tide, indeed, seems world-wide. Champneys warns,
“Forecast, if possible, and plan in advance. If not,
it will be hard to preserve in future a workable home.”<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a>
Van Name said at St. Louis in 1889, “The present rate
of library growth requires far larger provision for the
future, in space and in economizing space.”</p>

<p>“Every library in America <i>must</i> continue to grow.”—<i>Eastman.</i></p>

<p>“One cannot observe the rapid growth of libraries
during the last half century without being led to ask in
wonder what is to be the result in the future. There is
a law affecting the growth of libraries not unlike that
of geometric progression. By the principle of <i>noblesse
oblige</i>, a library which has attained a certain size is
called upon to grow much faster than when it was
small. It is difficult to foretell. For years to come
libraries will grow rapidly. Ingenuity will bring into
use new methods and new apparatus.”—<i>Fletcher.</i><a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></p>

<p>“Libraries designed to serve the needs of decades to
come prove too small before they are fairly occupied.”—<i>Dana.</i><a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span></p>

<p>“The model building of today will be quite out of
date tomorrow.”—<i>Marvin.</i><a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></p>

<p>Perhaps rate of growth cannot be calculated, but it
can be shrewdly guessed. It is hard to be too sanguine.
Growth in American libraries has oftener been underestimated
than the reverse. In an established library
you can multiply recent annual growth by twenty-five,
for the probable life of the building, and subtract possible
withdrawals. But moving into a new building,
and growth of the population served, will tend to make
needs for space increase in geometrical ratio rather than
merely arithmetical, and there are always gifts to be
anticipated. So let the sanguine members of your
board reckon growth.</p>

<p id="subhead-93"><b>Exterior.</b> Provision can be made by buying a lot
larger than you will need at first. A plan can be drawn
with future wings suggested, or more stories, or an ell.
This will require stronger walls, and study of features
which could be matched in making changes.</p>

<p>In large libraries, use of sub-cellars, especially for
stacks, can be looked to, and sunken stacks, or at least
subterranean caves for fuel, can be arranged under that
part of the lot outside the building, or even in some
cases under the street or an adjoining park. If the
experiments now making in various places are successful,
this growth downward may be almost as available
as growth upward. But see “<a href="#subhead-152">Stacks Underground</a>,”
and “<a href="#subhead-153">Stack Towers</a>,” in later chapters.</p>

<p id="subhead-94"><b>Interior.</b> There are several ways for providing for
changes inside. If you have enough money, build
largely, and space out. Provide more space for books
and readers than you can use at once. Make your
floor-cases movable, and set them wide apart, to
be closed up later as required. Set tables and chairs<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
generously apart, and crowd them together when otherwise
you would have to turn away readers. Provide
attic and cellar so built and prepared for subsequent
finish that they can be used to some purpose when
more rooms are wanted.</p>

<p>That reminds me to say that a wise provision is to
have as few rigid partitions anywhere, as possible. If
you must have any, make them so light, even if sound-proof,
that they can all be swept away when it becomes
desirable to change.</p>

<p>“Plan a library so that it may be susceptible of inner
development,” says Dr. Garnett.<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></p>

<p>It is always well to plan your shelving so generously as
to leave room everywhere for many years’ growth, and so
avoid necessity for early rearrangement.</p>

<p>In small libraries, if the book-rooms are built high
enough, provision can be made for a second tier of
wooden or metal shelves above that first installed.
Better always leave them thus high in the projection,
side, or corner devoted to floor bookcases.</p>

<p>With very large libraries interior provisions, except
in leaving floors or rooms unoccupied at first, and avoiding
rigid partitions, will be difficult.</p>

<p id="subhead-95"><b>Limitations.</b> In some libraries it is possible to
set a limit for desirable growth. For instance, the
faculty of the Episcopal Theological School in Cambridge,
Mass., could say that they never should want
more than seventy-five scholars or 50,000 volumes.<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a>
In branch libraries it is usual to decide in advance how
many books are needed, and to keep this number the
same, by withdrawing as many volumes as are added
from time to time. Suburban libraries can reduce the
normal limit of growth by arranging with their neighboring<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
urban libraries for a co-operative and interloan
system, or may unite with them in some such system of
segregating useless books in a common catacomb as
has been suggested by President Eliot. (See <i>Fletcher</i>.<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a>)</p>

<p><b>File Your Plans.</b> Too often, plans for growth carefully
made in planning, have not been preserved. When
need comes for them, perhaps often when librarian and
trustees have been changed, these provisions are not
remembered, or if faintly remembered have been laid
away where they cannot be found. The wise way is
to file your plans away in the library after using them,
and include in the portfolio your provisions for change,
both card catalogued so fully that they cannot be
missed. Even if conditions have changed before alterations
are demanded, the original forecast will be found
suggestive in making new plans.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span></p>

<h3 id="subhead-96">Approaches: Entrances</h3>

<p>Where the lot is large enough, there will be room for
simple landscape gardening which can add greatly to
the attractions and architectural effect of the building,
without adding largely to the cost. This is, however,
in the architect’s province. As is elsewhere suggested,
the park board or institution may assume or share the
cost of such embellishment.</p>

<p><b>Outside Steps.</b> In small buildings, the nearer the
main floor gets to the street level the better. If the
site is so high that there must be more steps to surmount
the basement, a few of these set inside the portico
or vestibule will prevent the building from being all
stairs in front. In larger buildings, flights of steps,
however sightly they are, are a hindrance to entrance
or exit, just so many steps to be surmounted in every
visit to the library; as bad as an unnecessarily large
vestibule, or long corridor—effort and cost wasted.
From a library point of view they are all wrong.</p>

<p><b>Porticoes.</b> These are unnecessary for library use,
and where economy is an object, are objectionable.
They spoil front light in the centre of the building,
where it is most needed. They give a heavy tone to the
library, and a suggestion of outgrown methods. If
they must be, <i>utilitas</i> requires that some use should be
found for them, and for the kind of vestibule they require.
In very large buildings, where architectural effect is
wanted, they offer an opportunity to concentrate it there,
and leave the rest of the outside walls to be treated for
inside light and convenience. Behind the columns,
unheeding their shadow, are places for a vestibule and
rooms above which do not require much daylight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span></p>

<p><b>Vestibule.</b> In libraries of average size only a small
vestibule is needed, and a lofty vestibule is a waste of
overhead space. All that it is needed for is to check drafts
and exclude dust, and to give chance for the stir of
removing wraps. A vestibule is often the best place
for stairs up or down. It should be under supervision
from the desk, through glass. In a large library, behind
a portico, it can be used as a reception, exhibition,
conversation, and waiting-room, being in a position
which need not separate departments, or usurp space
more needed for other rooms.</p>

<p>“Compact central vestibules, from which all departments
open in plain sight from the entrance, are better
than long corridors.”—<i>Champneys.</i><a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a></p>

<p><b>Front Door.</b> This is generally the main, often the
only public entrance and exit, and should be always
under supervision; in small libraries, from the desk;
in large libraries, from special attendants, who may
also serve as information clerks, umbrella checkers,
and special policemen.</p>

<p><b>A Revolving Door</b>, though expensive, serves some of
the purposes of a vestibule, or a storm door.</p>

<p><b>Other Outside Doors.</b> A separate staff entrance
is often advisable, a janitor’s door (usually to the basement)
is necessary; separate doors for the newspaper
room, the children’s room, and some groups of allied
departments are needed in large libraries. In libraries
of moderate size, where there are no such doors, the
municipal fire regulations may require special emergency
exits.</p>

<p><b>Swing all Doors Well and Wide.</b> Outside doors,
and doors from rooms for many occupants, should
naturally swing out, for escape in case of fire or panic.
The swinging of every door is a matter for special study,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
for not only passage, but wall space and convenience
depend on it. And have every door wide enough for
the maximum audience to come and go through. As
I was shot into a crowded room in the New York Public
Library recently by pressure from a throng so insistent
that it checked those who wanted to get out, a librarian
whispered in my ear, “Every doorway should be wide
enough to avoid such a mob as this.”</p>

<p><b>No Doors Between Rooms.</b> In fact, next to having
a floor without partitions, it is sometimes well to have
only wide openings through partitions, without doors.
Doors are only necessary when drafts are to be checked,
noise is to be excluded, or passage to be discouraged.</p>

<p><b>Height of Doors.</b> Unnecessarily high doors are a
waste; doors low enough to make a tall man dodge are
a nuisance; 6 feet 6 inches is about right.</p>

<p><b>Storm Doors.</b> The librarian of a very large library
reminds me of the necessity of storm doors for winter
in our climate, and says that architects seem unwilling
to plan them. Certainly every architect of every
library, large or small, should include such a structure
in his plans, to harmonize in shape and color with the
effect of the building. In small libraries, it will be the
only portico, or vestibule. In large buildings, under a
portico, it bars snow and weather and tempests from
direct invasion of the vestibule. Good taste can make
such an inexpensive structure sightly, but unless the
architect foresees the need and supplies the taste, some
carpenter hastily summoned when the need arrives, may
spoil a fine entrance with an ugly excrescence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span></p>

<h3 id="subhead-97">Halls and Passages</h3>

<p>Too much space wasted in these and in entrances, is
a bad fault frequently found in libraries, but easily
avoided in making plans.</p>

<p>“Should be sufficient, but not wasteful. Redundant
corridors show bad planning.”—<i>Champneys.</i><a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a></p>

<p>The English Building Act prescribes a width of 3 feet 6
inches to 4 feet 6 inches, for from 200 to 400 persons
likely to pass. Duff-Brown<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> thinks they should not
be less than four feet wide for “public traffic.” And
Champneys doubts they need exceed nine feet in width.</p>

<p>Are these passages absolutely necessary for library
purposes, in length, width, and height, is the test to put.
Can they not be omitted entirely?</p>

<p>In small libraries, it is a merit to have all rooms open
out of the noisy space which must be left in front of
the delivery desk. In larger libraries, passage through
reading-rooms is never allowable, and separate entries
are necessary. In very large libraries such passages can
hardly be avoided. In wings or ells, to utilize light for
rooms on both sides it may be necessary to have long
corridors lighted on top floors above, on other floors
from transoms.</p>

<p>The height of passages needs to be watched as keenly
as their other dimensions, for more than 6 feet 6 inches
or 7 feet is a waste of space which might in some way
be utilized in rooms or on other floors. Nine or ten feet,
however, may be required for light, ventilation, or
height of stories.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span></p>

<h3 id="subhead-98">Stairs</h3>

<p>Ornamental flights of stairs are usually wasteful and
disjunctive, especially in the centre of the building.
“They are never used by anyone; all go up in elevators.”—<i>Dewey.</i><a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

<p>See an excellent article by W. K. Stetson<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> criticising
the Newark Public Library.</p>

<p>A good rule is to have just so many flights of stairs
as may be required by the probable use of rooms on each
story, and to have them no wider or more massive than
passage demands. Stack stairways may be only two
feet wide; other service stairways not over three feet,
which allows passing of single users. Indeed, flights
six feet or wider should have a central rail, to keep
climbers apart from descenders. When floors are much
used, two separate narrower flights, for which room can
generally be found symmetrically, will be better than
one broader flight.</p>

<p>No stairs should be slippery or have projecting
obstacles to trip climbers, or be too steep or high-set for
old persons.</p>

<p><b>Treads.</b> Easy treads are essential to serve all
comers well. 5½-inch rise and 13-inch tread, will be
generous; 6½ × 11, tolerable. Brooklyn directions
specified 4-inch risers.</p>

<p>If any material is used which is, or will wear, slippery,
be sure to have some rubber or other stair-pad, well
secured, so that even the most unsteady climber cannot
trip or slip.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span></p>

<p><b>Material.</b> Stone wears down unevenly, and all
kinds of stone split and fall in case of fire. Marble is
slippery. Iron wears slippery. Wood splinters. Concrete
or stone, the treads covered with hardwood or
rubber, is probably best, all things considered. But in
small libraries, hardwood serves.</p>

<p><b>Handrails.</b> Dr. Billings sends warning that large,
ornamental stairs, outside or inside, should have some
form of practical handrails, and after trying to climb in
winter the outside steps of the New York Public Library,
and Columbia University, I heartily concur with him.</p>

<p>Indeed, bearing in mind the feeble men and women
who have a right to use a library, I plead for a “practical”
handrail for all stairs. Many flights have no rail
at all; the more ornamental they assume to be, the
more dangerous they are. Many flights have only
marble “rails,” too massive for hand use. All “architectural”
staircases are in fact deterrents of use.</p>

<p><b>Landings.</b> More than a dozen steps are tiresome to
most people, and in long flights landings ought to be
provided. If a seat can be provided on each, it will be
welcome to old persons. A window seat, in the windows
used to light flights of stairs, can be made a decorative
and also useful feature.</p>

<p><b>Circular Stairs.</b> About the most inconvenient, useless,
dangerous, and unnecessary feature which has come
down to us from antiquity is the corkscrew stair, which
still persists—I saw one in a plan only yesterday. It
is inconvenient because only half of each tread is available.
I measured one recently in a library: the wide
outside of each tread was twelve inches deep, and it
narrowed down to two inches at the central post. The
nine-inch width (about the least allowable for a stair
tread) was fifteen inches from the post, and only eight
from the outside. The usable part of the tread was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
eight inches wide, the wasted segment was two-thirds of
the width, and served only as a trap to stumblers.</p>

<p>This dangerous and inconvenient futility was unnecessary,
because a straight stair, with short flights
doubling on narrow landings, could be planned to occupy
no more floor area, with much greater practicable
width, and be infinitely more convenient and less dizzy.</p>

<p>Try to carry an armful of books up or down such
a flight, and remember the lesson. A ladder would occupy
less space, and be just about as useful as a
winding-stair. Why such a traditional inconvenience
persists in modern libraries is an enigma.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span></p>

<h3 id="subhead-99">Stories and Rooms Generally</h3>

<p><b>Height</b> of stories is a main factor in planning. The
fewer and lower they can be, bearing in mind full light
and ventilation, the less cost will go into unnecessary
bulk in building.</p>

<p>Tell the architect what rooms and floors you want,
with definite area and height for him to try to suit
together. Never let him dictate what dimensions you
must pack the rooms into.</p>

<p>In small libraries and in most branches, one story
with practicable basement, is the standard. The height
of this story is suggested by Miss Marvin as 12 feet, or
better, 13 feet; or 16 feet if a second tier of floor cases
must be provided.<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> She very sanely says that higher
rooms are not necessary from any point of view, and this
remark might be extended to most rooms in most
libraries.</p>

<p>Where there is a stack, the desire to have as many
floors of the building as possible, coterminous with stack
floors, determines the height of stories at 14 or 15 feet,
as the 7 or 7½-foot stack is chosen, and this will
make rooms whose heights, plus thickness of floors
(unless some use can be found for mezzanine rooms),
are exact multiples of stack heights.</p>

<p>In a larger library (but still small), a second story
over part or the whole of the main floor, can be lighted
from above and be used for many purposes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span></p>

<p><b>Basement.</b> The height of a basement will depend
on the uses contemplated for it. An auditorium requires
more height than small rooms for storage, vault, or janitor
service. Miss Marvin advises a height of 10 feet, so
that it can be used in any way wanted in future.<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></p>

<p>“<i>A failure to use it is a defect.</i>”</p>

<p>It must be absolutely dry, and fairly warm.</p>

<p>“A well-lighted basement gives more dignity of
elevation to a small building.”—<i>Bluemner.</i><a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></p>

<p>On a sloping site, a basement becomes ground floor,
and a cellar becomes basement, for part of the building,
with dark cellars and sub-cellars for the other part,
which will come handy for heating plant, fuel, storage,
and other functions. As the stack can run up and down
from the main floor, such a site can be made useful in
many ways.</p>

<p><b>Upper stories</b> become more and more difficult to use
unless there are elevators, which are costly to install
and costly to run. In old houses, coming as a gift, the
upper stories can be used for storage, study rooms, class
rooms, trustees, and other departments infrequently
needed.</p>

<p><b>The top floor</b>, where there are elevators, may be one
of the most useful stories, the most useful next to the
ground floor, because the possibility of good top light
allows every square foot to be used. If there are only
three stories, the top may be used for many purposes
without elevators, if the stairs are easy and ample.
The principal uses are, for serious reading rooms, exhibitions,
small study or class rooms, historical rooms,
special libraries or departments.</p>

<p><b>Use of Various Stories.</b> The assignment of rooms
will be governed by the exigencies and policy of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
library. A careful study of the use to be best made of
the floors will be of vital importance toward economical
and effective administration. In case of doubt as to
the size or location of rooms, inspection of existing
libraries of similar grade and class, and study of plans,
will be helpful to stimulate ideas.</p>

<p>“It is a mistake to have the library on the second
floor, at least the reading room and circulating department,
which should have easy access and publicity.”—<i>Fletcher.</i><a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></p>

<p><b>Correlation of Parts.</b> Guides to arrangement will
be consideration of processes, relation of users, and convenience
in all steps of use or service. A recent English
writer suggests arranging, in sequence from the entrance,
newspaper reading, magazine and light reading, delivery,
and quiet reference or reading rooms.</p>

<p>One great desideratum is continuous flooring on each
story, even into the stacks, so that trucks can be rolled
without jolt, and readers can pass without the discomfort
of two or three steps up or down, here and there,
as in many existing libraries. This irregularity of floor
level is one of the worst faults possible.</p>

<p><b>Mezzanine Floors.</b> Supposed architectural exigencies
so often demand stories of greater height than
library uses require, that it is well to have in mind what
mezzanine floors can be interposed here and there, and
what rooms can be assigned to them. Many staff rooms
(for instance, stenographers’ and others not crowded),
and many readers (<i>e.g.</i>, private students, small clubs,
teachers, classes, debating teams) do not require large
or lofty rooms, and would be much better if they had
only half the height of the large rooms. Only light and
ventilation may require much height of walls, and even
these only when many persons must use the same room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span></p>

<p><b>Not Thoroughfares.</b> By no means make any reading
room a passageway to any other room, or allow
stairs to run up into it or up from it. Some of the
worst faults to be found in existing libraries lie just
here. Whatever increases movement in such rooms
and disturbs students is a library crime.</p>

<p><b>Attics and Cellars.</b> In old houses, the occupation
of these unfinished spaces requires ingenious planning.
But attics furnish dry storage, cellars dark storage,
which can be utilized without expensive alterations.</p>

<p>In new buildings a cellar is essential, as a foundation
at least, but may be glorified into a practicable basement
without much cost; or may be minimized to an
air space in small buildings; or shared by air space at
one end and heating at the other. An attic is not so
necessary, except a shallow air space. But even shallow
attics can be utilized for storage-room by a trap door,
and it is marvellous how much need of such room will
be developed after occupancy.</p>

<p>If you have them at all, plan attics and cellars for
some future use, even if they are left unfinished for the
present. I remember an early experience of inspecting
a library building with a view to alteration, and finding
the attic so weakly trussed, and the cellar so solidly
partitioned, that neither could be altered for improvement.
Two-thirds of the building were thus wasted,
which could have been used if it had been wisely planned.</p>

<p>“A building should stand high enough on its foundations
to give the basement both light and dryness
throughout.”—<i>Winsor.</i><a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span></p>

<h3 id="subhead-100">Walls, Ceilings, Partitions</h3>

<p>The exterior walls come mainly into the province of
the architect, subject to chastening by librarian and
building committee as to material, decoration, massiveness,
and cost. “The ideal building has no breaks or
jogs and few corners.” The interior walls and ceiling
have been considered under the subjects of Height of
Stories and of Coloring. Under the latter head they
materially influence illumination also. In the decorative
scheme they should harmonize with the woodwork and
furniture.</p>

<p>The walls and ceilings not only play a star part in the
cheerfulness and beauty of the building, but they materially
affect the eyes and health of the reader. On their
coloring and the character of the reflection they cast,
largely depend the effectiveness of all diffused light, and
the best part of reading light. They form a subject of
especially important study.</p>

<p>Panelled ceilings which are often planned for decorative
purposes, especially in large and lofty rooms,
interfere injuriously with reflection of light, by intercepting
it with numerous shadows.</p>

<p>All authorities agree that there be as few partitions
as possible in small libraries, where departments can
be indicated, or readers separated, by railings, cords,
low bookcases, or screens of glass or light material,
which do not interfere with general supervision.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span></p>

<p>Many rooms can be arranged with sliding or folding
partitions, to be used for larger or smaller audiences,
as required.</p>

<p>In large libraries, necessary partitions can be of such
light construction that they can be changed or removed
at will. Some partitions are essential; for instance,
those of reading rooms to exclude noise, and of music
rooms to shut it in.</p>

<p>All partitions should match the other coloring and
style of rooms and furniture, to produce a quiet and
pleasing effect of harmony.</p>

<p>“Buildings costing less than $10,000 cannot afford
space for partitions.”—<i>Eastman.</i><a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span></p>

<h3 id="subhead-101">Floors and Floor Coverings</h3>

<p>Floors should be substantial, durable, cleanly, dry,
warm, noiseless, slow-burning, and not slippery.</p>

<p>Any uncovered floor will be noisy.</p>

<p>Stone, tile, mosaic, and concrete are noisy. Glass and
marble are slippery.</p>

<p>Hardwood, or softwood covered with linoleum or
corticene, will answer in most rooms and passages.</p>

<p>Variations of cork, or cork on a solid foundation, are
now common, and have been found satisfactory. Invention
is at work on this style of floor, and may evolve
something near perfection, if fairly cheap. Linoleum
wears badly, except in the best grades, and seems to
be going out of favor.</p>

<p>The new Springfield (Mass.) library has sawdust
concrete as a one-inch base for a cork carpet. The
St. Louis building just dedicated has wooden strips over
concrete to which a thick cork top is nailed.</p>

<p>Carpets and matting, general or in strips, are very
objectionable in catching dust or mud, and difficult to
clean off.</p>

<p>Rubber mats or rubber tiling has been favored for
floor-covering and for stairs.</p>

<p><i>The Librarian</i><a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> reports from England, as follows:—</p>

<p>“Stone, mosaics, and the like, are seldom used except
in lobbies.</p>

<p>“Plain boards do not wear well.</p>

<p>“Wood blocks (oak or maple), rift-sawn and dressed
(not washed), resist wear, though noisy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span></p>

<p>“Good linoleum, cemented on boards, blocks, or
concrete, resists wear.</p>

<p>“Rubber flooring seems superb, but has not been tested
here.”</p>

<p>[Nothing is said about corticene or cork, so much
used in America.]</p>

<p>Several “floor dressings” are advertised, said to be of
two general classes—dust-fixers, or beeswax polish.</p>

<p>Champneys<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> warns that angles of floor and ceiling
with walls, and all interior corners of walls, should
be rounded or “coved,” for easy cleansing.</p>

<p>Miss Marvin<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> thinks that for a small library, plain
cork carpet, of the best and thickest quality, without
pattern, is best, being durable, noiseless and easily
cleaned.</p>

<p>Bostwick,<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> discussing various forms, and criticising
each, says that a sheathing of soft wood, covered with
linoleum, leaves little to be desired, though it sometimes
rots, and that in various patent floorings no
trustworthy standard has been found.</p>

<p>My own advice would be to watch developments, and
take the matter up anew with your architect, in view of
his experience and inquiries, added to yours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span></p>

<h3 id="subhead-102">Roofs, Domes</h3>

<p>Roofs also the architect ought to know all about,
but don’t let him have them project so as to darken the
valuable top light of any windows. This is a fault common
in the bungalow type of small libraries. Whether
they are flat or have more or less slope is matter of cost
and effect. But if there is to be slope, except when there
is to be a timbered roof in some room underneath, have
it ceiled and used as an attic, even if low. You will not
usually want an attic, but if the architect wishes the
space, ask him to make it available for any future needs.</p>

<p>Of course, a tight roof is even more desirable in a
library than in most other buildings. Leaks are as bad
as fire for books, and are uncomfortable for staff and
readers. But that is a matter for the building expert.
So with fireproofing, for the roof is the exposed part
and hardest to protect from sparks from neighboring
conflagrations. In wooden buildings especially, have
some fireproof or very slow-burning material for your
roof: asbestos shingles, flat or corrugated tiles; or
better, some kind of the slates of various tints which will
match your walls; any of these will hold and extinguish
sparks.</p>

<p>A roof so built and lined with air compartments that
it will be warm in winter and cool in summer is a crowning
merit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span></p>

<p><b>Domes.</b> Many architects are fond of the effect of a
dome, but its top and bulb are of no use in a library,
and the obsession of space below balks compact plans
in the centre of the building. Domes cover many an
impressive, and more or less drafty, reading room, but
they waste bulk which costs, and dislocate departments.</p>

<p>If you see any views of libraries where domes are
conspicuous you may set them down as failures, however
beautiful;—bad types to imitate; their architects to
be avoided. The only possible place suitable for a dome,
is in a very large library, to cover a central reading
room, and even there the space it must occupy ought
to be very carefully studied at the outset, to calculate
whether so much open height is the best way to utilize
the cubic contents. It ought never be planned primarily
as an architectural feature, and thus imposed on library
methods, unless they are promoted by it, rather than
hindered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span></p>

<h3 id="subhead-103">Alcoves, Galleries</h3>

<p>From England, where alcoves in old libraries are so
fascinating to travelers, I find this passage in <i>The Library
Association Record</i>:<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> “The alcove system should
probably not be mentioned in an essay on modern
methods of book storage.”</p>

<p>Oldest of library methods, the alcove even now lingers
where it ought not. As I have said,<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> it is an agreeable
feature where solitude and ease are allowable, but it is
as much out of place in a public library as lounges would
be, wasting space, blocking supervision, delaying service,
deluding scholars with the illusion of isolation, and
making their nooks the convenient harbors for whisperers.
If you must have them, have them plain, and do not let
them creep into your reading room in the guise of
architectural piers and cornices.</p>

<p>“Alcoves oblige us to go twice as far as there is any
need of. A large part of the books might as well have
been stored in a compact stack.”—<i>C. A. Cutter.</i><a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a></p>

<p>“Privacy is marred when several readers occupy the
same table.”—<i>Fletcher.</i><a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a></p>

<p>“The alcove plan, obsolete and incompatible with
further progress.”—<i>Bluemner.</i><a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a></p>

<p>“Wasteful of space, impossible of supervision.”—<i>Champneys.</i><a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span></p>

<p>“The greater distance attendants must go, materially
affects the service.</p>

<p>“There is much discomfort to readers who go into an
alcove to be out of the way, and who are distracted by
the passing to and fro.</p>

<p>“Supervision from the counter is impossible.”—<i>Burgoyne.</i><a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></p>

<p>And the new-old monstrosity of the early American
type elsewhere described<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a>—may it never be revived,—the
unholy marriage of alcoves and galleries.</p>

<p>Alcoves might be used not only in private or club
libraries, but in such rooms as Mr. Foster’s “Standard
Library,” or the “Library of the Masters,” Mt. Holyoke
College, which may be regarded as cosy club-rooms, in
which easy chairs and footrests are not considered out
of place.</p>

<p><b>Galleries</b> survive in the old world, and in old libraries
with us, but they have no friends in new libraries.
They are better than high wall shelving served by
ladders. If less than 2 feet 4 inches wide, and if approached
by spiral stairs, they are nuisances to be
abolished.</p>

<h3 id="subhead-104">Light</h3>

<p>This is the most important topic in library planning.
Other problems considered elsewhere, the storage,
handling and service of books, affect economy and
efficiency of administration, the future annual cost of
good service, more than lighting; but this touches the
comfort and health of both readers and staff. Whether
the eyes of the public are weakened, and the service
they ought to expect from attendants is impaired, depends
largely on lighting.</p>

<p>On the shape, size and position of the windows, therefore;
on the selection, arrangement and installation of
the system of artificial lighting, depends the solution of
the question how can readers work? how can their servants
the staff work for them? how can both retain their
eyesight and health, best and longest?</p>

<p>This subject calls for serious planning by architect
and librarian, most serious consideration by the building
committee.</p>

<p>Here is one of the points where the best is none too
good, and where expense should be considered last. Economy
in first cost, economy in running expenses, must
be always borne in mind, but here surely is another point
where purely architectural features,—domes, columns,
approaches, marbles, ornament of all kinds,—should
be sacrificed, rather than convenience, comfort or health.</p>

<p>I treat this matter at length under the subsequent
heads of Light Natural, Windows, and Light Artificial.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span></p>

<p><b>Health of readers and books.</b> I have hunted in
vain for some exhaustive discussion of the influence of
electricity on health. I have found observations on the
effect of sunlight on the color of bindings; for instance,
Prof. Proctor’s Report of a Committee on Protecting
Leather from Light, in The Library Association Record,<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a>
where he says, “When building a library a good transparent
coloured glass may be employed which will not
only give an almost equal light when compared with
white glass, but will at the same time protect books from
the evils of direct light.”</p>

<p>I have also found many cautions against heat on the
head of readers from unshaded gas or electric lights too
near, but nothing on the general subject of electricity
as affecting either men or books. Experiments in this
direction are yet to be made.</p>

<p>See an article in Library Notes<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> on “The Eyes of the
Public.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span></p>

<h3 id="subhead-105">Light, Natural</h3>

<p>There has been so much difficulty in getting good
light into all parts of a library, and so much joy over
the substitution of electricity for gas, that there is some
danger of daylight being ignored. Dewey<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> pictured
“a solid core of books with modern lighting,” and
B. R. Green<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> argued elaborately in favor of disregarding
natural light altogether under certain conditions. It is
quite time someone championed God’s free gift to man.
For daylight, notwithstanding its occasional glare and
its temporary defects, is still the cheapest, the readiest,
the cheeriest, and the healthiest light for men and for
books.</p>

<p>Indeed, the modern advocates for substitutes seem
so far to have spared readers, and only included stacks
in their enthusiasm. But I have not yet entirely
surrendered hope of stacks, and I have many sympathizers.
The late James L. Whitney was an excellent
and experienced librarian. Not long before his death,
he and I were stumbling through the dark corners of
the stack in the library of which he was so long a faithful
servant. As we fell together, he turned and said impressively,
“If you ever plan a library, insist on having
ample natural light wherever you can get it.”</p>

<p>I quote Champneys<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> in support: “While the direct
rays of the sun are often sufficiently powerful to become
an inconvenience to readers and a source of injury to
[the bindings of] books, yet such are <i>their purifying
properties</i>, that their total exclusion is not recommended.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span></p>

<p>The old monk-architects knew their business. In the
earliest specimens of monastic libraries, note a full-width
window opposite each alcove. In the library of
the Sorbonne, Paris, in 1638, there was “plenty of daylight
on the desks from east and west, to fill the whole
length of the room.”<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a></p>

<p>Light should never be so admitted as to dazzle the
eyes of readers, or blind them while searching on the
shelves for books, or reading at their desks. The ideal
direction to strike them is from behind, and from the
left, with no shadows falling on book or paper.</p>

<p>Prismatic glass is recommended, to aid in throwing
light into dark places, like courtyards or cellars. Translucent
glass (as used in the Library of Congress) “sufficiently
softens the rays of the sun in the southerly
windows.”</p>

<p>“There should be abundance of daylight with least
direct sun.”—<i>Fletcher.</i><a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a></p>

<p>“Good, natural light is the first essential.”—<i>Marvin.</i><a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a></p>

<p><b>Aspect.</b> In planning, the aspect of each room is
very important. North, as in studios, is the best aspect
when direct light is always needed, though it will be
cold if without double windows in winter. East only
has direct light when it is apt to be most grateful, in the
early morning hours. South is apt to be hot and glary,
though the sun is too high at noon to strike far into the
rooms; but west lets in slant or level rays of hot and
blinding light which needs screening. Which front to
give a room is matter varying with climates and localities,
and needs special study always.</p>

<p><b>Modifying Glare; Curtains.</b> To certain aspects,
south and especially west, direct sunlight brings unpleasant
glare, and in summer intense heat, so that it
is really necessary to use shades or screens. Bostwick<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
recommends that shades for large windows be double,
either up or sideways. In the Library of Congress all
the shades in each stack can be drawn or withdrawn
simultaneously. This is often the arrangement for high
windows in large reading-rooms.</p>

<p>It may be pointed out that good taste in choosing
colors for shades will do much toward allowable and
very effective decoration in a library, without added
expense.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span></p>

<h3 id="subhead-106">Windows</h3>

<p>These are features on which architect and librarian
may lock horns. The needs of the interior may call
for different windows in every room. The apparent
needs of symmetry may demand uniform height of all
windows in each story outside. But proper planning
requires settlement of the ideal windows by inside considerations.
When the architect comes to try the effect
of these in his façade they may not accord with any of
his first sketches. Then comes the tug of war. Can
the windows be worked in as they are? Can they be
changed, and yet serve the same purpose? Can the
height of the stories be changed, the rooms be swapped
around? Can a becoming irregularity of exterior be
devised?</p>

<p>It will usually be found possible for an ingenious
architect to overcome apparently insurmountable difficulties,
with surprisingly satisfactory results, even
to the architect. In a recent problem, I wanted
certain windows of certain dimensions. The architect
did not see how they could be made to comport with
the prescribed style of the building. But he would not
despair, and after several attempts he devised windows
which fully satisfied both of us, and pleased our building
committee. “Where there’s a will, there’s a way,”
even architecturally. Remember this when you come
to windows. Anyway, don’t allow them to be planned
for purely ornamental purposes. Insist that they
properly light the rooms first, and afterwards be made
comely, if possible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span></p>

<p>“A library should have windows in abundance.”—<i>Bostwick.</i><a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a>
Another authority says you cannot have
too many windows, or too large, even if you have to
screen them. “Ample, even excessive light should be
admitted to all reading rooms.”—<i>B. R. Green.</i><a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a></p>

<p>For small libraries, or those of medium size, the
“box-frame sliding sash” windows are best, and can be
got machine-made. They can be made tight, are
easily managed, and furnish the simplest method of
ventilation, as is elsewhere described.</p>

<p>In larger libraries there are various kinds used. Airtight,
non-opening windows have been advocated for
stacks, to exclude dust and drafts (the windows in the
Library of Congress stack are of this kind), but they are
not much favored. French windows, pivoted at the side,
or long windows pivoted in the middle at top and bottom,
will admit air freely in summer. There are various
patented devices to hold a pivoted window open just
so far as may be desired.</p>

<p>Really the whole matter is for the architect, with the
librarian’s advice as to what is most wanted in each
room. Light always, clear light, which usually precludes
stained glass, but may demand translucent or
prismatic glass. Ventilation, perhaps, which requires
some way of opening the whole or part of the window.
Easy cleansing always, which also requires ready opening,
or a balcony outside. Due protection against fire,
which requires wire-glass.</p>

<p>All windows in reading rooms should run up clear to
the ceiling, for ventilation, and because top light penetrates
further. “One square foot of glass near the
ceiling admits as much light as ten near the floor.
Pointed Gothic windows are bad.”—<i>Burgoyne.</i><a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> For
the latter reason, all windows in reading rooms should<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
be square-topped (which shuts out the Gothic style),
and not overhung by eyebrows, nor should they have
thick sashes, bars, leads or mullions, which hamper light.
Leaded glass, especially in diamond or lozenge forms, is
hard to clean. Clear, large panes of good plate glass
are best. Study use rather than ornament everywhere,
but most in windows.</p>

<p>These suggestions as to school rooms might apply to
libraries:—</p>

<p>“The top of the windows is placed as near the ceiling
as the finial will admit. Transom bars should not be
permitted.”—<i>Sturgis.</i><a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a></p>

<p>“Large sheets of glass rather than the art filagree work
so often used, which obstructs fifty per cent of the
light,”—<i>Burgoyne.</i><a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></p>

<p>With these essentials in mind look at the illustrations
under this head, or <i>passim</i>, in Sturgis’s Dictionary of
Architecture, and see how few of the picturesque windows
there could be used for any reading or administration
room of a modern library. Either pointed or overhanging
tops, or heavy frames, or transoms, or mullions, or
traceries, or leaded panes, must be barred out by the
architect who designs libraries.</p>

<p><b>High or Low.</b> If the windows must run to the
ceiling, they have to be high. How long they are to be,
how low they extend, depends on the height of the story
and whether or not wall shelving is wanted below them.
If the library has more than one story and has a stack
to limit the height of stories to fourteen or fifteen feet,
shelves all round the wall will be wanted in many of the
rooms. The shelves at extreme height should only be
eight feet to top of cornice, or could be any less height,
down to about four feet, that the exigencies require.
The window can take up as much of the remaining height<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
of wall as needs of lighting demand. This leaves some
alternatives of length and width for the architect in
arranging his exterior.</p>

<p>High windows above wall shelving are much used,
as exterior views will show. One consideration has
occurred to me, which I have not seen mentioned. In
libraries where there is no window low enough to jump
out of, and only one entrance on a floor, where is the
extra fire escape usually demanded by municipal building
regulations?</p>

<p><b>High or Low for View.</b> Some objection has been
made recently to high window sills in a library because
only low sills allow a cheerful outlook. I just put the
alternative to a working girl, as a typical user, and
she said, “How could I read if I was watching a squirrel?”
This seems to put the matter in a nut-shell. Library
windows are for light, not for sight. In private libraries
or in clubs, the cosy comfort idea can come uppermost,
but in the more practical rooms, especially in reading
rooms chiefly for reference use and study, I should get
diffused cheer, so to speak, from diffused light, and bar
looking out of the window. As to the working rooms,
much the same view might be taken, but if a librarian
or a cataloguer pleaded for low sills and a cheery outlook,
I might consider the “personal equation,” and
concede it.</p>

<p>“In German schools, window-stools are set high, and
the lower sash glazed with ribbed glass, so that the
pupils cannot look out.”—<i>Sturgis.</i></p>

<p><b>Skylights.</b> From the plans I judge that flat skylights
are more often used in English libraries than with
us. Much objection is made here about keeping them
tight and clean, and certainly leaks and grime are fearsome
in a library. But I have heard architects aver that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
skylights can be made leak-proof, and if they can there
are certainly many perplexities of light they would relieve.</p>

<p>“Top lights always should be double to stop direct
sunlight and prevent draughts. There is great trouble
in making them rain-proof.... Large squares of plate
glass are better than small panes or leaded lights....
Double windows are necessary where traffic is heavy.”—<i>Burgoyne.</i><a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a>
[This is a provision to deaden noise. In
America, a double window is only a protection against
winter cold.]</p>

<p><b>Clerestories.</b> There is often this alternative, to
“cabin” the skylight, or set regular clerestory windows
in the walls. This can be made a beautiful feature, and
if it does not add too much to the expense, and if enough
light can be got by them, in the proper spots, with provisions
for easy cleaning, they are certainly free from
most of the objections to skylights.</p>

<p>[See effective clerestory windows in the “Concourse”
of the Salem Public Library.]<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span></p>

<h3 id="subhead-107">Light, Artificial</h3>

<p>But granting the superiority of daylight, it is available
at the best for no more than part of the library
day. The thronged hours generally follow a winter
twilight, and sometimes range far into the evening. What
light is most cheery, the clearest, the healthiest, and the
cheapest, for these long hours of use?</p>

<p><b>Oil.</b> Very small libraries have little choice. They
have to cling to the old-fashioned oil lamp. But they
are not so unfortunate after all, for though filling and
trimming and cleaning make trouble, no softer or better
reading light has been invented; and swinging argands
can give excellent diffused light, as many a country store
will show. With a few such lamps and an open wood-fire,
no such cosiness and cheer can be matched by a
city library.</p>

<p>You can manage good home-made shades to moderate
the glare, from home-made material—even from brown
paper. It will be well to cling to oil until you have
no time to attend to the lamps.</p>

<p><b>Gas.</b> The next stage is acetylene gas, which can
be had without a public plant, and furnishes a steady
and brilliant light. After it, comes usually the regular
gas stage of community development. If the gas plant
is good, the light may be good too, though its fumes
are often hard on lungs and books. If the plant is poor,
better go back to oil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span></p>

<p><b>Electricity.</b> But the use of electricity has become
so general all over the country, even in small towns,
the light is so good, so safe, and considering the advantages,
so cheap, that you are likely to arrive soon at the
electrical stage, and remain in it permanently through
the various steps of your growth. It is unnecessary in
these days, to warn against defective installation; any
architect should be able to arrange that; but watch it
carefully, in planning and as the contractors put their
wires in.</p>

<p>With either form of gas, or with electricity, the choosing
and placing of lights will be one of the most important
of your joint problems.</p>

<p>As far back as 1886, J. E. L. Pickering contributed
a paper on the electric light, to The Library Chronicle<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a>
which is so sound that it is worth reading now—a generation
later.</p>

<p><b>Location.</b> In placing your lamps of all kinds, do
not think first of symmetry or appearance, but try to
find where the fewest bulbs, of the kind you determine
to use, will bring the best light most directly on the places
where it is wanted, with the smallest expense.</p>

<p>The kinds of illumination required are:—</p>

<p><b>Diffused.</b> This is the general light in corridors and
rooms, sufficient for moving about, usually got from
chandeliers, sometimes from wall brackets.</p>

<p><b>Shelves and service desks.</b> In usual systems, these
are lighted, the desks by different kinds of fixed or hanging
desk-lights, the shelves by a goose-neck protruding
at the top, from the cornice between every two ranges.</p>

<p><b>Readers’.</b> Usually lighted by rows of lights, shades
down the center of the tables; or movable individual
standards near the readers’ chairs, or by hanging
lamps, six or eight feet from the floor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span></p>

<p><b>In stacks.</b> By bulbs at the ceiling of each desk,
either hanging down, or doubled up.</p>

<p><b>Colors.</b> As elsewhere noted, light colors in walls,
ceilings, shelving and furniture, aid any system of lighting
by reflection.</p>

<p><b>Switches.</b> The location of switches is most important
both for effectiveness and for economy.</p>

<p><b>Systems.</b> I do not propose to discuss here all the
systems of lighting or makes of lamps and fixtures,
but I wish to record a very deliberate opinion as to
the proper trend of experiments in library lighting.</p>

<p>Seeing a book advertised on “Practical Illumination,”
by Cravath and Lansingh, I bought and have carefully
looked it over. The seven pages it gives to libraries
have not helped me at all, but I have found on other
pages matter of interest. This, for instance:—</p>

<p>“The object of artificial illumination is to enable
us to see things.”</p>

<p>“It is undoubtedly true that the eye is more comfortable
when receiving a moderate amount of light from
all directions, <i>as it does in daylight</i>, than when getting
all its light from a bright page in a dark room.”</p>

<p>“The ceilings and walls, if light in color, have considerable
value as reflectors, especially in small rooms.”</p>

<p>[On page 7 is a table of percentages of light reflected
from different wall papers.]</p>

<p>The scientific discussions of forms of bulbs, the material
of reflectors and the forms of shades, are very interesting.
So is a series of “demonstration room tests,” especially
No. 11,<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> showing a fine diffused light, thrown from a
concealed bulb by a reflector at the ceiling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span></p>

<p>“Even more important than the economic side of the
subject is the disastrous effect on the eyes caused by
numerous common artificial lighting arrangements.”</p>

<p>“The ruin of eyesight now common with artificial
light is due to the fact that so few people understand
the importance of the proper placing, reflecting, and
shading of artificial lights.”</p>

<p>“In order not to injure or fatigue the eye, the following
points should be avoided:—</p>

<ul>
<li>Flickering light,</li>
<li>Glaring lights,</li>
<li>Glare reflected from paper,</li>
<li>Light from unusual angles,</li>
<li>Too little light,</li>
<li>Too much light,</li>
<li>Streaks of light,</li>
<li>Sharp contrasts of dark and light.”</li>
</ul>

<p>“In the lighting of desks there are five principal requirements:—</p>

<ul>
<li>The lamp should be out of the line of vision.</li>
<li>Have no regular reflection or glare from paper.</li>
<li>Have the light free from streaks.</li>
<li>Avoid too great intensity.</li>
<li>The light should be steady.”</li>
<li>[I add: Don’t get in your own shadow.]</li>
</ul>

<p>“The three reflectors best suited to lighting the shelves
of the library are the opal dome, the fluted opal cone,
and the prismatic reflectors.”</p>

<p><b>Indirect lighting.</b> This is defined thus: “The
lamps themselves are not visible. They are placed in
cup or vase or trough mirror-reflectors, from which the
light is thrown up towards the ceiling, to be thence reflected
down into the room.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span></p>

<p>Systems of this kind as used in libraries for all service
except in stacks—for diffused light, shelves, service
desks, and readers’ tables—seem to me to be most like
natural daylight, and therefore best unless too costly.</p>

<p id="subhead-108">The Report of Oculists and Electricians on the Boston
Schools,<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> reported against indirect lighting, believing
that “the cost of current to secure a proper illumination
would be prohibitive.” They added, however,
that “No actual experiments were made with indirect
lighting, as objections to its use seemed so obvious as
to render them unnecessary.”</p>

<p>This was in 1907 (for schools) before the experiments
in libraries described below had been made.</p>

<p>So far they seem successful. The Crerar Library has
tried one for two years. Mr. Andrews says in his last
report (1912): “The indirect system of lighting has
been extended over the official catalogue and the offices.
Longer experience confirms the opinion that under suitable
conditions the system is the best for the prolonged
use of artificial light, although this is not always recognized
by persons accustomed to more concentrated illumination.
For this reason it has been supplemented
to some extent in this library by table-lights in the
reading-rooms.” He writes me further, “It is undoubtedly
more expensive, but it is in my opinion also much better.”</p>

<p>A similar system was installed in the John Hay Memorial
Library at Brown University a year ago. Mr.
Koopman writes me (Apr. 18, 1912):—</p>

<p>“Given rooms reasonably adapted for it I should call
it the ideal library system.</p>

<p>“In our high reading-room [twenty-eight feet high],
the conditions are especially unfavorable owing to the
deep panelling of the ceiling. But if I were to choose
afresh I might still prefer our present system; I certainly
should if I could have a flat ceiling [for maximum<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
reflection of light]. But for rooms of twenty
feet in height and under I do not see how for library
purposes one could choose a different system; certainly
most rooms in libraries come within that range.”</p>

<p>As the height of the ordinary room in a library need
not be more than twelve or thirteen feet; or, if it has
to correspond with two stack stories, 14 or 15 feet; Mr.
Koopman’s commendation would hold for all library
rooms, except lofty halls.</p>

<p>About the lighting of the lofty room, Mr. Charles A.
Coolidge, architect of the John Hay Library, writes as
follows:—</p>

<p>“I think the indirect method of lighting in the rooms
where the ceilings are not high, is very successful. It
is only in the main reading-room, where it made so
many hanging fixtures, that I did not like the effect;
it is also expensive, as they have to use so many more
lights. It does not seem to me very cheerful there, and
I think the effect would be better if we had two chandeliers
in the room at appropriate places where they would
give a general illumination, and would be high enough
to keep the light out of one’s eyes.”</p>

<p>I hear that this system is also used in the new St.
Louis Public Library building, but have no report as
to its merits.</p>

<p>From these experiences, west and east, and from my
own observations of other systems in very many libraries,
I am prepared to recommend trial of indirect lighting;
especially as encouragement of makers will undoubtedly
induce them to remedy any faults and develop
all merits. For diffused light it is enough, always and
everywhere. For shelves, from top to bottom, it is
enough. For staff desks and for readers with strong
eyes, it is enough. Weak eyes, accustomed to concentrated
light, may need more; hence I take it the extra<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
Crerar lamps. New patents are already appearing.
Mr. Andrews further says in his letter: “A combination
of this method with the direct system, called ‘semi-indirect,’
is used in the City Club at Chicago.”</p>

<p>It is even possible that the expense of installation and
operation may be reduced.</p>

<p><b>Fixtures.</b> Have these plain and substantial. If
you do not try some indirect system, but hold to direct
lighting, do not surrender yourself to the first or the
most insistent agent. Urge your architect to a deliberate
study of lamps, their power, position, bulbs, and shading,
and indeed all their appurtenances and fixtures.</p>

<p>Do not, in the first place, let the architect arrange the
lamps for picturesque effect. If he can make the lights
ideal for service and for readers, well and good; but
get the utilitarian effect first; the artistic afterwards,
if you can.</p>

<p>Again, do not accept too meekly the salesman’s or
contractor’s or architect’s selection of shades and fixtures.
Watch, inspect, read everywhere, and when you
make up your mind clearly what is best for you, insist
on getting it. But avoid especially “art fixtures.”</p>

<p>I have been especially warned not to use the ornamental
chain pendant for chandeliers, like that shown
after p. 14 of the above mentioned Report of Oculists.
The slightest draft will twist them, and break the wires
inside.</p>

<p>And for desk or table electric reading lamps, use the
movable and self-adjusting kind, so that every reader
can turn on his own light, and arrange its angle as he
chooses.</p>

<p><i>In General.</i> Very large libraries can perhaps economize
by installing their own electric plants, but get<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
them outside the building if possible, as the jar of the
engines and their whir are disturbing. In a group of
municipal or university buildings, the library can get
its current from a common source.</p>

<p>L. B. Marks, 103 Park Avenue, New York, has written
a paper on “The Design of Illumination in the New York
Carnegie Libraries.”<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> In this he advises consulting a
specialist in every new problem.</p>

<p>In fact, with the complexity of functions in a large
library, the need increases of seeking the advice of
specialists on many points;—heating, lighting, ventilation,
stacks, fireproof vaults are subjects where
neither the librarian or the architect may know all
the latest phases of the subject, and really want
skilled information.</p>

<p>Champneys<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> recommends that oil lamps be kept
lighted at stations all over a library, lest sudden failure
of the electric light plunge it into darkness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span></p>

<h3 id="subhead-109">Heating and Ventilation</h3>

<p>Except far north, these look out for themselves fairly
well. As winter approaches, they ought to look out
for each other. When you begin to plan for artificial
heat, you can plan for ventilation at the same time.</p>

<p>In the smallest libraries, in wooded regions, wide
fireplaces with wood fires make cheerful if not very
even heat, and excellent ventilation up the chimney. In
places where wood is scarce or dear, some sort of stove,
like those used in groceries, depots, or schools, is next
called into play. The interior view, for instance, of
the Keene Valley Public Library (in Eastman<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a>) shows
such a stove at the right. The floor plans show a “wood-house.”
In buying a stove, one of the makes with a
jacket, on the furnace principle, can combine heat and
ventilation best.</p>

<p><b>Fireplaces.</b> We do not often use coal grates, but
architectural features common in our libraries are wood-fireplaces.
The excuse for introducing them is cosiness,
cheerfulness, and ventilation. They are certainly cosy
when a fire is kept up, but tending them requires a
deal of time, the heat is rather irregular, the ashes are
a bit blowy. Ventilation is no better by fireplace than
through any other aperture, unless some sort of flame
is kept up—a tiny gas-jet under the flue sometimes
serves as an irritant. As usually built they cost money;
and they usually interfere with wall-shelving which is
needed. In small libraries with wall space to spare,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
where wood is the cheapest fuel, it may be well to have
a fireplace with a fire tended by the townspeople; but in
larger buildings fireplaces are generally nuisances, to be
banished to the trustees’ room, if the architect wants one
somewhere.</p>

<p>Champneys<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> thinks “open fires are to be avoided in
all public rooms, because of unequal distribution of heat,
of dust and noise, and of labor.” This is undoubtedly
true of soft-coal grate fires, such as they have in England,
but has Champneys ever seen the cleanly cheer of a
country fireplace, full of six-foot logs? Few of us can
afford them even in forest regions, but what an invitation
such a glow offers in a rural neighborhood!</p>

<p>The next step beyond the stove would be the ordinary
dwelling-house hot-air furnace; doubled or reinforced
by a small one, if the house is a little too large to provide
properly-gauged heat for all varieties of weather by one
furnace.</p>

<p>During these smallest stages of growth, reliance for
ventilation can at first be placed on crevices, occasional
opening of doors, and the open chimney.</p>

<p><b>Window Bar Ventilation.</b> When these rudimentary
means become inadequate, the simple device of window
bars (as I have found in my own house and office for a
generation past) will keep even the air of crowded
rooms freshened, without drafts. There are many
patented devices embodying this principle, but there
is no need to waste money on them. The village
carpenter can saw out for every window a plain duplicate
of the lower bar, a quarter of an inch shorter,
but beveled like it, to slip in easily and tight. When
the lower sash is lifted, this bar inserted, and the
sash shut close to it, there is a space above between<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
the two sashes, which at the same time lets out the foul
air, and lets in the fresh, without any perceptible draft.
The only caution to be observed, even in cold weather,
is to put the bar on the leeward windows, away from
those against which the wind is blowing too strongly.
This simple fresh air system is very effective. Try
it on one window anywhere, and see if you do not
like it.</p>

<p><b>The Next Method.</b> Next comes steam heat, very
common, very unsatisfactory, very cheap; with radiators,
very ugly in a library, very much in the way;
requiring some scheme of admitting sufficient fresh air
regularly, and ejecting air that has been breathed.</p>

<p>A low-pressure indirect hot water system gives the
best heat, most easily managed and properly combined
with fresh air supply. The only reason that it is not
universally adopted is that steam boilers and radiators
are cheaper. Here, however, is one of the alternatives
in library building where the money available ought to
be put into health and comfort rather than into mere
show.</p>

<p>For ventilation, in the simpler forms of steam and
hot-air heating, the simplest, cheapest, and often most
effective method is to take fresh air by several inlets
direct from outside, up under radiators, to be heated
by passage through them and let out into the room.</p>

<p>In large libraries, some more effective system of heating,
with forced draft ventilation by blowers, fans or
inducers, must be installed by the architect under advice
of competent engineers. The part of the librarian in this
stage of planning will be to get the building committee
to take the most effective method, rather than the
cheapest, diverting to this essential of health some of the
funds which can be withheld from inside or outside ornament.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span></p>

<p><b>Temperature.</b> One of the striking differences between
England and the United States is that in the standards
of temperature, Champneys<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> calls for 60° to 62° Fahrenheit
for rooms, 56° for corridors. Burgoyne<a id="FNanchor_215b" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> reports 50°
in the stack at Strassburg.</p>

<p>The A. L. A. Committee on Ventilation and Lighting
takes as the standard 70° as a medium temperature for
the circular inquiries it is making. It is usually assumed
that a lower standard may be set for stacks, and places
where attendants or readers move around rather than
sit. Certainly we try to keep our houses and offices
and the reading-rooms of our libraries 68° to 70°.</p>

<p><b>In General.</b> An article in “The Librarian,”<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> specifies
five heaters, thus:—</p>

<ul>
<li>1. Open fire grates; cheerful but troublesome.</li>
<li>2. Hot-water radiators; popular.</li>
<li>3. Steam radiators.</li>
<li>4. Gas or electric heaters; only for small rooms.</li>
<li>5. Coal stoves; not desirable in libraries.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Thermometers.</b> Perhaps the architect can plan
his heating apparatus so cleverly, or your janitor can
run the plant so watchfully, that an equable and agreeable
temperature can be maintained everywhere. Among
your fittings, however, do not fail to plan for plenty of
thermometers as indicators to be watched by the staff.
Underheating promotes discomfort, coughs, colds; overheating
stupefies staff and readers.</p>

<p><b>Basic Advice.</b> In 1893 Dr. John S. Billings, now of
the New York Public Library, published an interesting
and sensible volume on Ventilation and Heating, in
which, however, no special mention is made of libraries.
I quote some general remarks, which seem pertinent:<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a>—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span></p>

<p>“It is important that those who form and direct
opinion on this subject should look to it that the buildings
which they plan, and especially those in which
numbers of men, women or children are to be brought
together, are so constructed and arranged <i>that no one
shall poison himself or others by the air which he expires</i>.</p>

<p>“I do not mean by this that every man should aim
to be an expert on plans and specifications for ventilation,
nor that he should rely on his own judgment as to the
best way to secure it, but that he should insist on having
it provided for, and should see that skilled advice on the
subject is obtained.</p>

<p>“Among the first questions which the architect has to
solve for each building which he plans or constructs, in
order to secure good ventilation are the following:—</p>

<p>“<i>First</i>—How much money shall be allowed to secure
ventilation in this case?</p>

<p>“<i>Second</i>—Which of several methods should be employed
to effect this, taking into consideration the character
and location of the building, and the amount of
funds available?</p>

<p>“It is also the business of the architect to see that the
builders do not, in a spasm of economy or retrenchment,
make a reduction in some point which will affect the
ventilation, <i>rather than cut off some of the merely ornamental
and comparatively useless decorative work of the
exterior</i>.</p>

<p>“However much the architect may be inclined to let
the owners have their own way in planning their own
residences; when it comes to public buildings, it is his
duty <i>not only to advise but to insist</i> on proper arrangements
for heating, ventilation, drainage and plumbing. If it
be his misfortune to deal on such matters with ignorant
committee-men who with a limited appropriation persist
in omitting, for, the sake of cheapness, some of those<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
points in construction which are essential for keeping
the building in proper sanitary condition, it is <i>his duty
as a skilled professional man to decline to have anything
to do with the matter</i> rather than suffer himself to be
used as a tool to execute work which he knows will be
dangerous to the health and life of his fellow-citizens
or of their children.”</p>

<p>These are ringing words to be addressed to an architect.
How much more do they apply to the librarian who
is the expert adviser not only as to effective methods
of work, but also as to the comfort and health of all his
staff and for all the public who are to use the building.</p>

<p>A paper by Dr. Billings, on the special subject of
Library Heating and Ventilation, after his experience
in New York, first in old buildings and now in a new
building, should be of very great value.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span></p>

<h3 id="subhead-110">Plumbing, Drains, Sewers</h3>

<p>This is another group to be provided for satisfactorily
before any money is allotted to frills. The architect
ought to be expert in all three specialties; but a householder
wants to know just what the architect is going
to do in building his house. The librarian is in this
instance the housekeeper, at least, and has not only a
right, but a duty, of inquisitiveness; for carelessness
or mistakes on the part of draftsmen, ignorance or
worse on the part of workman, might seriously affect
the health of a large number of people.</p>

<p><b>Underdraining.</b> Is your lot dry down below the
foundations of the building? See to this before you
start to build, for a damp basement for a library leads
to book-tuberculosis, if nothing worse.</p>

<p><b>Drains.</b> Gutters send a lot of water down from the
roof, and unless this is led away by tight conductors,
leading into drains that are sure to carry it off, the resulting
moisture will gather along the foundations and
show on the inside walls. I have had experience and
expense with this trouble on my own premises.</p>

<p><b>Sewers.</b> In cities, drains and sewers usually combine
in joint drainage. Here you have to watch your own
grounds, your neighbors’, and the town’s connections;
avoiding interference, and watching for loose joints, careless
workmanship, and downright dishonesty. Watch
your architect, watch the contractors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span></p>

<p><b>Plumbing.</b> Be very careful that the water pipes
do not run too near, or behind or directly under or over
the shelves. Bursting pipes threaten damage and disaster
to books.</p>

<p>In indicating where you want your water-fixtures,
remember that unnecessary scattering entails unnecessary
expense. Economy demands, and efficiency rarely
forbids, putting pipes in stacks up and down stairs, one
fixture under another, and all near chimneys or somewhere
else safe from freezing.</p>

<p><b>File plans.</b> As suggested under another head, keep
your plumbing and drainage plans separately, file them
in a pamphlet plainly labelled and catalogued. You
may want in a hurry sometime to know just where every
pipe and drain can be got at easily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span></p>

<h3 id="subhead-111">Cleanliness</h3>

<p><b>Prevention.</b> It has been suggested that library
windows, especially stack windows, be made tight, never
to be opened; but the hermetically sealed library does
not seem to appeal strongly to the public. Dust can
be excluded by carefully planned vestibules, and by
opening windows only at certain times, and in certain
winds, when dust outside does not drive in. In many
large libraries, methods of dust-absorption are provided
for air-inlets, and such excluders are common to all systems
of forced draught.</p>

<p><b>Inside Dust.</b> In addition to the dust that drives
in from the street, and that which rises from mud tracked
in, there is some that is evolved from certain book-bindings
and from processes of handling, which has to be
kept down. Library housekeeping is a steady process.</p>

<p><b>Cleaners.</b> The old-fashioned sweeping and mopping
with the old implements, are not yet out-of-date, but
there are many more or less expensive patent sweepers,
which are supposed to be dustless. Vacuum cleaners
have come to stay. Mr. Hodges of Cincinnati anticipated
their use in libraries years ago, and made an effective
machine of his own. A simple way is to open dusting
ducts, in which books may be dusted while all dust is
blown away outside. But in a large enough library, it
is now wise while installing a stack, to have some
system of vacuum standpipes built in to reach every
floor; and in any library some of the simpler and more
effective forms of patent sweepers or vacuum cleaners
may be provided and stored in basement, attic or
closets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span></p>

<p><b>Bowls and Taps.</b> Sinks with taps for filling pails
are useful on all floors, for scrub-women and for first
aid in fires. They can easily be combined with wash-bowls,
thus avoiding multiplicity of fixtures.</p>

<p><b>Wash-bowls.</b> Using books is not always cleanly
work, and both attendants and readers often need facilities
for washing their hands. Wash-bowls can be concealed
in closets or tucked into special cupboards in
shelving, where they are not obvious. There are too
few of them oftener than too many in a library. Consider
the rooms there where staff or readers might wish
to wash their hands after handling dusty books. Frequent
ablutions would cleanse the users, and protect
books. Children, sometimes adults, come to the library
with grimy hands, so that wash-bowls near entrances
may be welcome conveniences. But all bowls should
be set where they can be watched by one of the staff.</p>

<p>“The library of the future will be found to contain
lavatories where every one wishing to use books will
first have to cleanse his hands.”—<i>Reinick.</i> See <a href="#Page_222">p. 222</a>
<i>post.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span></p>

<h3 id="subhead-112">Protection from Enemies</h3>

<p>Blades in his “Enemies of Books” enumerates Fire,
Water, Gas, Heat, Dust, Neglect, Bookworms, Mice
and other vermin [to which he might have added book
thieves, extra illustrators, mutilators and defacers].</p>

<p>Against the latter group, supervision is a deterrent.</p>

<p>Gas is vanishing before the electric light.</p>

<p>Neglect we cannot allow, or plead guilty to.</p>

<p>Bookworms and vermin have not apparently worried
our libraries as much as those of the old world. They can
hardly be guarded against in building, except as we
guard against moisture and filth.</p>

<p><b>Fire</b> is a great danger in our climate. There is some
quality in the atmosphere—some latent condition akin
to electricity, which feeds flames. We have concluded
that limits of expense and considerations of convenience
render it impossible to make our buildings, or any part
of them, except the vault for valuables, absolutely fireproof.</p>

<p>In view of the fact that books will always remain
combustible, and sensitive to injury from smoke and
water, it is now generally conceded that all we need
aim at is isolation, slow combustion through “warehouse-construction,”
hollow walls, iron or steel shelving,
and the like.</p>

<p>Outside iron shutters are considered clumsy, and not
so good protection as distance from other buildings.
Inside iron doors are frequently neglected, and tend to
curl up in hot flames. Local fire regulations sometimes
require protected doors through partitions—for which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
slow-burning wood, tinned, is preferred. These are
often interposed between the stack and the rest of the
building. The stack can be made more fireproof than
the rest, without much extra expense. Its greatest
danger, shared with other parts, is from crossed electric
wires. Against these, careful installation by conscientious
electrical experts is the chief protection.</p>

<p>Thoroughly fireproofing the boiler-rooms, ash-pit
and waste-paper bin is a protection any building can
have, and in many cases these can all be set outside.
Heating-pipes can be kept from contact with woodwork
or books, and can be protected with asbestos or otherwise.</p>

<p><b>Material</b> is a great factor of danger or safety. Wood,
unless treated chemically, is more dangerous than iron
or stone, but inside iron needs protection from flame, lest
it yield when most needed. In the San Francisco fire,
brick and terra cotta withstood heat better than marble,
granite, sandstone, or limestone.<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a></p>

<p>The great use now made of concrete for floors, ceilings,
partitions, and walls renders modern buildings safer from
fire, and is to be commended especially in libraries.</p>

<p>The roof is vulnerable and should be of non-inflammable
material, fireproofed if possible. Sparks blown
from neighboring conflagrations, lighting on an unguarded
public building, give the greatest outside danger.
Tar roofs are said to be non-combustible, when
properly gravelled, but do not be too sure of them. Tile,
slate, asbestos-shingles should insure you.</p>

<p><b>Elevators.</b> These and lifts furnish in their shafts
dangerous draft-flues for fires starting below. If there
is any way to provide doors and trap-doors easily managed,
to shut off every floor, one great danger of spread
of fire is removed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span></p>

<p><b>Glass.</b> As outside shutters are objectionable, tough
wire-glass, which does not break easily from heat, will
furnish a measurable protection from outside fire, without
materially diminishing light. Indeed it may transmit
or reflect light better than large panes of plate glass,
which shatter too easily.</p>

<p><b>Fire-buckets</b> on every floor, prescribed in many
insurance regulations, are not so necessary when
there are water-taps handy everywhere, as recommended
above. Fire extinguishers, however, are not
superfluous.</p>

<p><b>Standpipes.</b> In large buildings the local fire department
can aid the architect by suggesting the most
effective location for service pipes to command every
corner of every room and passage most effectively and
economically.</p>

<p><b>Lightning.</b> Lightning rods, once deemed so essential,
do not seem popular now, but metal standpipes,
and steel stacks, well-grounded, would certainly serve
to carry lightning down to the depth of permanent
moisture. I cannot hear that lightning has ever found
stacks attractive.</p>

<p><b>Water.</b> Leaks are bad for books, and fussy for folks.
Roofs and cellars may let in moisture, and a library
needs tightness in both. Unless it is well constructed
and tested at the outset, the leaks, the seepage of a
building are hard to find and to stop. No care and
thought should be spared concerning this insidious
enemy, from choosing the site to flashing the roof-tree.</p>

<p>Since drafting this chapter, I am reminded by an
article in Vol. I of the “Library Association Record,”<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a>
of certain bookworms or grubs I have found in old books
from the damp shores of our gulf states. Mr. Widman<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
of St. Charles College is quoted as saying, “We see the
time when we shall have to burn part of our books to
save the other part.” But I find no suggestion as to any
provisions in building which would check such pests.
Rigid exclusion of moisture from foundations and walls
would probably be the only palliative.</p>

<p>I have noticed cloth bindings of books, especially public
documents from gulf states, badly eaten by roaches.</p>

<p>William R. Reinick, Chief of Documents in the
Philadelphia Free Library, has printed results of experiments
as to insects that destroy books, in Scientific
American Supplements of Dec. 24, 1910, and May 11,
1912. He says:—</p>

<p>“It has been stated that more books have been
destroyed by small forms of life than by fire and water
combined.”</p>

<p>“Heat, dampness, and dirt deposited in handling
books, develop worms, etc.”</p>

<p>“Libraries keep many books in dark places, badly
ventilated. Darkness, damp air, and leaving books
long undisturbed, favor propagation of small forms of life.”</p>

<p>“<i>Light and cleanliness</i> are the two most important
factors in preventing the ravages of insects and also of
fungi which grow upon and in books in a damp, warm
atmosphere.”</p>

<p>While few libraries in our northern states have
suffered from book worms and the like, will it not be
well to experiment before entrusting rare books to
sliding cases, or any books to dark central or especially
underground stacks?</p>

<p><b>Stacks.</b> There is one danger in many stacks. A
wide space is left between “deck” and shelves on each
edge. The danger of dropping small articles like
pencils and pads is elsewhere spoken of, but do not such
unnecessary wide spaces increase the danger of fire
from below and leaks from above?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span></p>

<h3 id="subhead-113">Fireproof Vaults</h3>

<p>But if it is deemed unnecessary to go to the expense
of fireproofing the whole building, it is certainly necessary
for every library which has valuable books, manuscripts,
or records, to have some sort of a strong room,
proof against both fire, moisture, and ordinary book-thieves.
This should be large enough for present treasures
and probable growth, and can be treated as one
of the luxuries of the building, where luxury can be
afforded. It need not rob any reading-room of light,
but can be located in a dark corner of the cellar or elsewhere
which seems useless for any other purpose. Unless
watched, builders are apt to slight vaults, and finish
them rough, shabby, or damp. This is inexcusable, now
that such conveniences are common in banks, even
in small towns. There must be many expert and honest
vault builders in every large city. For light, ventilation
and comfort refer to any “Safe-Deposit Vaults” below
banks. For absolute security read of the safety with
which so large a quantity of bonds came out of the
Equitable fire in New York. When you allot your bids,
take the expert constructor of the firm contracting for
the vault into your confidence, and ask his advice about
such late improvements as need not increase his bid.
He ought to want the advertisement of your approbation
as much as you want an excellent piece of work.</p>

<p>A plain fireproof brick bin for waste paper and rubbish
and one for hot ashes are guardians against fire.</p>

<p>A common safe will be enough for the account books
and most essential records of a small library which cannot
afford a vault. If the floor is made strong enough,
it can be kept in a corner or a closet reserved for it in
the librarian’s or trustees’ room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span></p>

<h3 id="subhead-114">Central Spaces</h3>

<p>Large rectangular buildings have central spaces and
one of the first questions for the planners—indeed the
key to the whole design—is “what use shall we make
of this space, leave it open, devote it to reading or delivery,
or occupy it by stacks?”</p>

<p><b>Areas</b> are often used to light basement windows, but
they are apt to catch rubbish and in winter to invite
snowdrifts, which are difficult to clean out. Where they
must be used they are better if extended to form a sort
of moat, wide enough to be reached by a special flight
of steps, for use in cleaning, and lined with white stone
or glazed brick to reflect light into the basement.</p>

<p><b>Courtyards.</b> In large buildings, a large courtyard
admits light to all the interior walls, but is usually too
wasteful of space. The interior is generally used either
for delivery, reading or stack; not solidly occupying the
whole available space; lighted from the top, and so
shaped as to leave small corner courtyards as shafts
for light and air. If the walls of these shafts are faced
with glazed brick, they may light, very effectively, inside
rooms, passages and stairs.</p>

<p><b>Kept Open.</b> In the Boston Public Library, the central
space was planned for architectural effect, and left
open. This arrangement, if the interior walls had windows
planned for light, rather than for effect, would
render both faces of all four sides of the building, available
for useful rooms; but as it is, adequate light is not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
given to rooms, and thus is wasted. When attention
was called to this waste, and to the disjunctive effect
which threw communications out to exterior lines, the
advocates of the scheme enlarged upon the opportunities
it would give for readers to carry books out there and
read under the æsthetic effects of a canopy which excludes
direct light from the lower story, as the monks
of old are pictured as using their arcades. With this
in mind I have often peered out there from the staircase
windows, but have never detected such a reader.
The present effect may please æsthetic visitors, but I
doubt if it could secure a vote from practical modern
librarians.</p>

<p><b>Central Reading Room.</b> With the huge reading
rooms of the Library of Congress and the British Museum
in mind, anyone can understand this use, which
is striking. Whether it is the ideal form for a reading-room
is more doubtful. It certainly, when high, wastes
a deal of room in upper space, not needed for light or
ventilation, and it needlessly blocks light which might
render the inner fronts of the building useful for various
purposes. In this position of the reading or delivery
room, the corresponding stack would cross the rear,
and perhaps range along the sides of the rectangle.</p>

<p><b>Central Delivery.</b> Another use is for the main
delivery, with generally a lower roof than a reading-room
would have unless obstructive. If light for this
is drawn from above it will be ample for enough floor
shelving to bring certain parts of the open-access books
near to the desk and catalog.</p>

<p><b>Stacks.</b> Sometime in the future, all the central
space of a large building may be given to a solid stack,
from sub-cellars to roof, lighted only by electricity,
ventilated from above by forced draught, and opening
on reading and administrative rooms all around.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span></p>

<p>But until this era of dark storage (which heaven forfend!)
there is a possibility of stacks in the form of cross-sections,
or a Greek cross, with corner areas for light
and air, and feeding a smaller central room for reading
or delivery, or even feeding suites of reading rooms
around the perimeter after the fashion of the Library of
Congress building.</p>

<p><b>Combination.</b> Still another use of the center space
is possible (as in the new Brooklyn Central Library
plans): stories of stacks below, delivery-room above,
on the level with the ground floor of the building; the
reading room above that.</p>

<p><b>Dark Places.</b> There will inevitably come corners in
every building where full light cannot get in. Some
faulty buildings are full of such corners. Study the
plans you find, to detect such faults and avoid them.
When your own plans, after all your care, disclose such
spots of darkness, think over your various needs and
see if some use cannot be made of such otherwise wasted
gaps. There are some closets, even rooms, which do not
require any light, or require it so seldom that a flash of
electric light, now and then, will serve almost as well as
daylight. For instance, there is the book vault, the
photographic dark room, many closets for supplies,
shelves for duplicates; heaters, coal bunks, ash and waste
paper bins, <i>et id genus omne</i>. All such that you can relegate
to places hopelessly dark, will leave so much more
free daylight to be used.</p>

<p><b>Closets.</b> Closets in a library need not be as numerous
as in a dwelling house, but they are about as useful.
Careful planning can get them in where they are wanted
without sacrificing space which can be used for books or
readers. For instance, rooms as you have to fit them
into your floor plans often have one dimension a bit too
long. Some times, you have a librarian’s room which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
seems rather to waste two or three feet farthest from the
windows. Make a closet of this, or a nook for drawers
and books. The next room is a thought too wide.
Slice two feet off the width into a row of cupboards or
wardrobes. Show your ingenuity in such refinements of
planning.</p>

<p>And every closet is much like every library. It is
capable of, and it deserves individuality. Instead of
making a dozen closets alike, plan a separate use for each,
and lay out its drawers, shelves, cupboards, books, wash-bowls,
beforehand. This will save you steps and minutes
later, and reap the satisfaction of smooth service.</p>

<p><b>Store-rooms.</b> Store-rooms differ somewhat from
closets—they are more wholesale. They require much
planning in detail. Do you want bins, open shelving,
or glass doors? Do you want hinged doors, or sliding?
Do you want bins or drawers below, and shelves above?
Do you want the same treatment all round and perhaps
in the middle of the floor? Do you need high
shelves, or pigeon-holes, or pegs, or hooks?</p>

<p>You must plan storage for stationery, material, labels.</p>

<p>Closets of course, can be used for storage, in addition
to other uses, toilet, wraps, etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span></p>

<h3 id="subhead-115">Lifts: Elevators</h3>

<p><b>Lifts.</b> By this phrase are designated booklifts—for
single volumes or small lots, as distinguished from elevators
to carry passengers and boxes. Lifts are chiefly
used in stacks, and will be considered under that head.
They are also needed between administration rooms
on different floors, as from the unpacking room to the
catalog-room, and from the desk or the stacks up to
special reading rooms.</p>

<p>For small libraries, hand lifts can be made to run
easily. In larger libraries, electric lifts save a deal of
time, but these are more expensive in first cost and cost
of operation and repair.</p>

<p>Champneys<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> says, “Line cages with leather or rubber.
Attach clips for papers.”</p>

<p><b>Elevators.</b> These are not at all needed in small libraries,
and their use should be postponed as long as possible
as a library grows larger, not only on account of
initial cost, space required, and danger of furnishing
upward drafts in case of fire, but because of the treble
cost of running—power, manning and tinkering. They
are one of the necessary nuisances of large buildings.</p>

<p>When used, they may be installed in dark inside
corners, and should so accommodate passage up and
down that less space need be put into staircases. They
should open outside rather than inside rooms, even if<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
special corridors have to be provided. The stir of operation,
entrance and exit is very disturbing for staff as
well as for readers.</p>

<p>The necessity of installing an elevator marks a debatable
and epochal point in the development of a library.
Indeed I have thought of classifying buildings,—those
which can get along without elevators; and those that
must have them. Here comes a great leap in the expense
of operation.</p>

<p>The number of elevators in the building, their size,
their position, the system of operating them, all have
an immediate bearing on annual operating expenses,
and in very large libraries need a vast amount of
special study and conference.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span></p>

<h3 id="subhead-116">Mechanical Carriers</h3>

<p>Some jubilation has been expressed by librarians and
architects over the conquest of space through the aid of
invention, but space and time have not yet been entirely
annihilated. Two hundred feet by carrier may be shorter
than a hundred by foot, but it is still twice as far as a
hundred feet by carrier, and in planning to use mechanical
aids, it is still necessary to remember that a straight
line is the shortest distance between two points.</p>

<p>For small packages and small libraries, tubes (pneumatic
propulsion or exhaust) are the simplest contrivance
for horizontal carriage, and they will serve many
purposes in larger libraries.</p>

<p>In large buildings it is usually wise to provide some
sort of machinery from remote parts of the stack to the
delivery desk, and also direct to the reading-room floors;
although the leading specialist on this subject, Bernard
R. Green<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> of the Library of Congress, warns that they
should only be adopted as a matter of necessity, for
they require expenditure, space and complicated machinery.
There are forms to be studied in most of the
very large libraries, government, university and public.
As every new library building will probably devise some
decided improvement in tubes and carriers, I will not
take space here to describe the different devices now in
use, but will advise very careful study of every problem
as it arises. Burgoyne<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> describes the Boston Public<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
Library System.<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> The Library of Congress underground
system which has been in continuous service
satisfactorily since 1897, has also been very well described
in The Library.<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a></p>

<p>It seems to me that the services I have seen are heavier,
clumsier and slower than is necessary, and that something
of the ingenuity that has been put into commercial
cash-carrier systems might devise for libraries book-baskets,
run on wires, which would serve all purposes
for single volumes or small lots of books. Those now
operating also suggest frequent stoppages for repairs.
“Carriers that turn corners are apt to get out of order,”
says Bostwick.<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a></p>

<p>But at all events, no conveniences of machinery should
serve as an architectural excuse for separating or
increasing distance between departments.</p>

<p><b>Tunnels.</b> For passage from cellar of one building
to another in groups; or from one wing to another in
the same building, underground passages may be required.
They are usually floored, ceiled and walled,
with stone or cement, but it has occurred to me that in
some cases, large cast-iron water pipes, well laid, would
make a cheaper, tighter, stronger and otherwise more
satisfactory communication. For staff usage the height
of a small man is sufficient; for bulky boxes the size
of a car running on rails, and drawn by hand or by endless
chain, would define the width, and a slight additional
height would allow for overhead hanging book-baskets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span></p>

<h3 id="subhead-117">Telephones and Tubes</h3>

<p>These are most necessary for quick work. All libraries
with more than one story, or even more than one
room, can use speaking-tubes to advantage. They are
inexpensive, and are easily put in while building. If
installed at first, they need not cost much, and save
many steps, if they be run only from the librarian’s desk
to the janitor. For larger libraries, they can connect
desk and stack, librarian and assistants, departments
with each other. In stacks they are very serviceable,
placed next the lift and running both to delivery desk
and to janitor’s room. In still larger libraries some
form of house-telephone will speed and simplify service,
with an exchange desk, switchboard, and special operator.</p>

<p>Consult the local telephone company about the different
styles and prices. You will perhaps be surprised to
find how cheaply they can be set and run, even as compared
with a speaking-tube system.</p>

<p>Dr. Richard Garnett recommends the telautograph
for transmitting inquiries and orders,<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> and also says,<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a>
“In planning large libraries, it will be necessary to take
mechanical contrivances into account to a much greater
extent than hitherto.”</p>

<p>Less marble columns, fewer dadoes, and more tubes
and telephones, would ensure a better working library.</p>

<span class="smaller">ADMINISTRATION ROOMS</span></h3>

<p>While books are the substance of a library and readers
the object, how to bring them together is the key to
arrangement of the plan; therefore the first consideration
among rooms is here given to administration.</p>

<p>Except as otherwise specified later, the working rooms
ought to be put in the center of the library, in order of
processes for handling books and serving readers, and
ought to be in the most direct connection possible with
each other, with stacks and with reading rooms. Here
centers good planning.</p>

<p>Always remember what economy lies in close connections,
concentration, and short distances.</p>

<p>Every saving in communication may mean an attendant
saved, and a smaller pay-roll.</p>

<p>“Ease and smoothness of administration are to further
public service or lessen expense.”—<i>Bostwick.</i><a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a></p>

<p>“They must be in sequence, so that books may be
(1) received; (2) catalogued; (3) prepared; (4) shelved,
without jumping around from one part to another.”—<i>Idem.</i><a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a></p>

<p>See excellent article by W. K. Stetson on centralized
administration, 36 L. J., p. 467.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span></p>

<p>In his article on Library Buildings, in the U. S. Public
Libraries Special Report of 1876,<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> Justin Winsor pictures
the preliminary operations of preparing books for the
reader—the first steps of administration, as carried
out in a large room, surrounded by stalls connected by
tramways for book boxes, and supervised by a superintendent
from a raised platform in the centre, who directs
the successive operations and operators, all under his
eye.</p>

<p>This arrangement persists, but except so far as it governs
packing and unpacking, is now usually separated
into different rooms, all made parts of a suite, connected
either horizontally or perpendicularly, and served by
special lifts and elevators.</p>

<p>Such rooms for a large library are here described in
separate chapters. In smaller libraries practically the
same operations are compressed into fewer rooms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span></p>

<h4 id="subhead-119">Trustees’ Room</h4>

<p>In very small libraries none is necessary; nor need one
be set aside, as the library grows larger, until other more
necessary rooms are provided for. The trustees as a
body do not meet every day, and their committees
only meet an hour or so at a time, so that they can
well use one of the staff rooms whose occupants can
temporarily get busy elsewhere, or use special rooms
only occasionally used.</p>

<p>In growing libraries, when rooms have to be set aside
for any purposes which do not require constant occupation,
any one of these can be used for trustees. Their
meetings, and those of their committees, are generally
held in late afternoon or evening, when it would not interfere
with intermittent processes or infrequent readers.
It has always seemed to me that a Local History room
would be an excellent refuge for trustees in a building
where space had to be economized, especially as local history
is a proper function for a small library with either
an active librarian, or an active local society, or both.</p>

<p>When the library gets larger, it is well to consider that
the trustees represent the public which owns the library.
They are usually selected with care for what is held to
be the most honorable position in town. They serve
without pay. In character, in prominence, in responsibility,
in service, their board deserves prominent recognition
in planning a building. As they will use their
quarters less often than staff or readers use their rooms,
they need not take up any space which is desirable for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
active departments. They can be put anywhere in the
building where space can best be spared. But as they
are sometimes elderly men, they ought not to be expected
to climb many flights of stairs, and in buildings without
elevators, should not have to go higher than the second
floor.</p>

<p>In furniture and decoration, a deal of money has been
wasted on trustees’ rooms. They ought to have a cheerful,
cosey, dignified and comfortable room, but as no
library ever has enough money for its actual needs, it is
willful and sinful waste to devise massive and costly
furniture (usually very uncomfortable) and splendid
ornament, for the modest gentlemen (and ladies) who
will spend a few hours there every month.</p>

<p>Good proportions, cheerful color, good natural and
artificial light, a warm carpet perhaps, a ceiling not too
lofty, comfortable yet not necessarily expensive furniture,
with lockers or hat racks, even a fireplace if the
architect thinks it would add to the effect of the room
(here a fireplace would be most permissible); these will
make an apartment where trustees can be at their best,
wise, sensible, never contentious or captious.</p>

<p>Even then, it does not seem necessary to set aside an
otherwise useless room entirely to a board which occupies
it so seldom. Think if it cannot be put to some
special use, for clubs, or if that would desecrate it, to
housing some special collection not likely to be wanted
at the hours of board meetings. By all means shelve it
round about—there is no decoration in a library like
books in good binding, even in bright cloth covers,—and
let it be one of the semi-public rooms, to be shown
with pride; or sparingly used by those readers or students
who deserve to be ranked as users with trustees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span></p>

<h4 id="subhead-120">Librarian’s Room</h4>

<p>Though the delivery room be the center of service, the
librarian’s room is the center of direction. Whether it
should be close to the delivery room or to any special
department, depends first upon the size of the library,
then upon its class and methods. Sometimes it is
thought well for the librarian not only to be in close
touch with his staff, but to be accessible to the public.
If he does not wish to use his time entirely as an information
clerk, a position may be assigned to him quite apart
from staff or public rooms, on any floor. Modern systems
of tube or telephone (which should always be
liberally provided to keep all departments in close call),
will sufficiently overcome distance to enable him to
summon to his room anyone he wishes to see. Champneys
even suggests an extra exit as an escape from bores,
if they succeed in getting in.</p>

<p>Where his position is to be, in the building, it is for
the librarian to decide, provided the trustees approve
him sufficiently to keep him to run the new building.
He is to run it, and he ought to have the place which
will let him run it most easily, according to the methods
he may wish to follow. No one else should compel him
to go where he will be hampered by any discomforts.</p>

<p>As to arrangements and furniture, there will be needed
such tables as the size of the room may allow, such chairs
as the occupant may require, as well as enough for
visitors, wardrobes for his clothes, closets for his stores
(see list of stores which may be needed in a stationery
cabinet—<i>Duff-Brown</i><a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a>), private toilet room, a space<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
(usually) for a small fireproof safe for his and the trustees’
valuable immediate papers, such wall shelving as
he may require for his personal books and bibliography,
telephone and tube space handy to his seat, a keyboard
for keys, and enough free floor space for such revolving
bookcases and such floor cases as he may further require,
not to forget passage room for visitors.</p>

<p>As to location, so as to arrangement, the librarian
should here have a free hand, however much he must
yield his preferences elsewhere. It is his room, and
should be a part of his individuality. To allow this to
him, is the first and longest step toward good administration
during the whole life of the building.</p>

<p>In England, a private residence is often provided in the
building for the librarian, but seldom or never in America.</p>

<p><b>Ante-room.</b> In a library of some size, a comparatively
small room, or even two or three low rooms are
very much better for the librarian than one large, high
room. If there is an assistant librarian or private secretary,
he needs a separate room, and if there is to be a private
stenographer, she can share this outer room, and either
part of it, or still another room can be assigned to staff
or public, waiting for their turn of admittance. Indeed,
a suite of three not very large rooms is quite ideal,
especially as many of the librarian’s impedimenta can
be distributed over the larger shelf and closet space
available.</p>

<p><b>Heads of Departments.</b> In a large library with
departments, each of their heads should have his own little
room or rooms, according to his duties and the bulk of
his records, close to the center or edge of the groups of
rooms he is to manage, with such tube and telephone
communication as will place him in close touch with
the librarian, with his inferiors, and with such other
departments as he aids in serving.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span></p>

<h4 id="subhead-121">Other Staff Quarters</h4>

<p>Staff work is divided by Bostwick<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> into,—</p>

<p><i>Administrative</i>, which would cover librarian, his assistants,
and heads of departments.</p>

<p><i>Contact with the public</i>, including those of advisory,
educational, or disciplinary duties.</p>

<p><i>Clerical</i>, subordinates in offices and catalog departments.</p>

<p><i>Buying and distribution</i>, including those engaged in
preparing and circulating books.</p>

<p><i>Care of Building.</i></p>

<p>This would indicate a group or number of rooms for
each class, the “administrative” (already treated) and
“buying and distribution” somewhat clustered, the
“clerical” and “contact with the public” distributed
among the others, and the “care of building” generally
centered in the basement.</p>

<p>In addition to these classes or groups, a general room
or rooms will be needed in a large library for staff meetings,
staff lectures and staff training school. One large
room should serve alternately for all such purposes,
especially if divided by sliding or folding partitions to
make of it either a large or small room as desired.
Special audience or school furniture is needed here.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span></p>

<h4 id="subhead-122">Public Waiting Rooms</h4>

<p>These are not wanted in small libraries, where the
space left in front of the delivery desk will provide for
casual visitors as well as for those waiting for books.</p>

<p>In large libraries, it is well to provide a place where
visitors can rest and have the privilege of talking, and
where members of the staff may see friends, if necessary.
This is best near the main entrance. Indeed, a vestibule
demanded by the architecture can be utilized as
such a room, and if it can also be made a show room
for book rarities and curiosities in glass cases, a museum
for statues, busts and portraits, and a general porter’s
hall and information office, it will justify its existence
and relieve the working rooms in the library of many
embarrassments. Here, also, may be bestowed grand
staircases and all cumbrous architectural features that
cannot be wholly barred out.</p>

<p>Such very public rooms, as distinguished from what
might be called service waiting rooms like the librarian’s
ante-rooms and the space left before the delivery desk
for the applicants who have sent in slips and are waiting
for their books—are better outside of the partitions of
the working library. The latest plans for the Brooklyn
central library provide, on a triangular lot, for an apex
which seems to fill this need and some architectural
features, without seriously infringing on working or service
areas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span></p>

<h4 id="subhead-123">Stenography Rooms</h4>

<p><b>Staff.</b> Besides the private typewriter of the librarian,
there will be others in large libraries for heads of
departments (indeed, wherever there used to be a clerk
or secretary, there must now be a machine), and a
number in the catalog suite, ranging up into the tens or
twenties, as more or less books are being put through
various processes. These all may be called staff
stenographers.</p>

<p>Even in libraries of moderate size, where there is a
possibility of gifts or other growth which will require
special cataloguing, it is wise to leave room in the cataloguing
suite for extra stenographers, when suddenly
wanted.</p>

<p><b>Public.</b> There is also needed in large libraries,
provision in private study rooms for readers or authors,
and some special rooms for public stenographers on call,
ready for extra staff or readers’ demands for copying,
dictation, or anything legitimately connected with the use
of books. Such rooms are among those to be placed
on mezzanine floors or in a special wing or corridor.
Like music rooms, they ought to be built with sound-proof
or sound deadening floors, walls and ceiling; for
readers who are not dictating are often and excusably
sensitive about the clicking of others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span></p>

<h4 id="subhead-124">Place for Catalog Cases</h4>

<p>This chapter covers the space to be allowed in rooms
for the catalogs themselves.</p>

<p>Very large libraries require whole rooms for catalogs
alone, usually one room for the general card catalog
and another for the Library of Congress cards.</p>

<p>In all but very large libraries, card catalogs for the
staff and for the public must be provided for in some
way. They can be separate, but the form most economical
of space is the double-ender set into the wall
between cataloguer’s room and delivery department, with
drawers which can be pulled out from either end. The
obvious inconvenience is that they may be wanted at
both ends at once. Notwithstanding this, they are
much used, to save space if not labor.</p>

<p>A nice problem in planning is the placing of card-catalog
cases not too far from the delivery desk, where
they will not interfere with other uses, and where they
will get ample light. The most usual way is to set them
against partition walls, with space in front for a narrow
table to which drawers can be moved and rested during
use.</p>

<p>Another convenient arrangement is to make a sort of
floor case, a wide table in the middle of the floor, with
catalog cases back to back on top, leaving a ledge
on each side and at the ends, where the table projects.</p>

<p>Stools are used with these rather than chairs, mainly
because they take up less room and are not used for long
periods.</p>

<p>The English books speak of other styles of catalogs,
but we use no other form except (rarely) different kinds
of printed catalogs, which are kept loose on tables or
desks.</p>

<p>As to floor space required for catalog cases, see that
heading later on. Placing them is a nice and critical
question of planning.</p>

<p>Note that a Library of Congress card-catalog room
separate is called for by the Brooklyn Public Library.<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a></p>

<h4 id="subhead-125">Cataloguing Room</h4>

<p>In small libraries, cataloguing has to be done in the
librarian’s rooms or at the delivery desk. In larger
libraries one large room or a suite of rooms is needed, and
requires careful planning by an experienced librarian.
Ample light is naturally the first requisite. North light
is most regular and less glary, but is somewhat cold and
cheerless. Large windows, or what is practically one
window along one side of a room, the windows running
up from the level of the tables clear to the ceiling, are
best. The working tables (better single or double desks
perpendicular to the windows) should occupy the window
side, with service tables (trestles will do) in the next
space. Then floor cases for bibliography and books in
transit, also perpendicular to the light, and wall cases
beyond with a ledge, will conveniently furnish the room.
If, as usual, the different processes of handling books are
performed in this room, not only cataloguing proper,
but selection, ordering, accessioning, shelf-listing, collation,
labelling, numbering, and marking or covering,
must be foreseen, in due succession. A lift at one end
from the packing room should bring the books, to follow
the order of work, over bins, or tables, or desks, or
shelves, leading either to the delivery desk or the stack.
One room is often not enough—a suite of rooms is required,
perhaps up and down stairs. (Do not be tempted
to use circular stairs; they are criminal; see under that
head, <a href="#Page_177">p. 177</a>.) See the John Hay Library plans, for a
central “stack,” so to speak, of such rooms, planned
for speedy and economical service.<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span></p>

<p>For order of work, see Winsor,<a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> and Bostwick<a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> who
enumerates other processes. This suite is a cosmos in
itself, for which no architect unadvised could possibly
arrange.</p>

<p>Even with an expert librarian to advise, the local
librarian and the local corps of cataloguers ought to be
consulted, and their methods and tastes should be heeded.
An irritating incidence of light, an awkward stretch or
carry to the shelves, a clumsy arrangement of desk-surfaces
or window seats, might disconcert the best of
cataloguers, and so far spoil the building.</p>

<p>See view of the cataloguing room in the Library of
Congress, L. C. Report for 1901, p. 224.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span></p>

<h4 id="subhead-126">Delivery Room</h4>

<p>This is the department, under our American system,
which in all libraries should be on the ground floor,
and as short a distance as possible from the front door.
In small libraries, it should be the center of the ground
floor space, where that whole floor, and the top or foot
of such stairs as there are, can be supervised by one
attendant. Miss Marvin<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> locates it approximately as
12 feet (minimum) from the door, 16 to 20 feet “to the
rear shelves,” but this of course depends on the size of
the building.</p>

<p>Oscar Bluemner<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> thinks that the counter, the catalog,
and applicants need not take up more than 10 × 15
feet in a small library.</p>

<p>In somewhat larger libraries the need of central location
holds. The book shelves are generally behind the
desk, one reading room (or two sober-reading rooms) on
one side, another (or two where a certain amount of
stir and noise may be expected) on the other. The space
in front, from desk to door, should be planned for most
of the stir and necessary noise, except that of open
shelves. If there is a small vestibule separated from the
delivery room by a glass partition, drafts and dust will
be shut out, and a space allowed for the flutter of entrance
and exit, leaving the space from door to desk for book
applicants, querists, passage to other rooms, catalog case,
bulletins, waiting, and such other uses as may be assigned
to it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span></p>

<p>Champneys<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> warns that the space here should be
calculated for the maximum use at any time of day or
evening, not for an average. Of course, so noisy a room
cannot be reckoned on for any kind of reading, although
if large enough such guides as directories, railway
time tables, local maps, etc., might be used here to
advantage.</p>

<p>Such a delivery desk should not be put in a room intended
for study or quiet reading, unless perhaps in
colleges, where stir may be expected as classes come and
go every hour; but even here the entrances and exits
should be put where the delivery desk stir and catalog
use are on one and the same side, leaving the centre
and other sides for readers, to be as undisturbed as
possible.</p>

<p>In large libraries this delivery room can have more
and roomier facilities, such as settees for those waiting
for books. In the Providence Public, there is an Information
desk on one side, a Registration desk on the
other, near the front door. It should still be on the
ground floor and not far from the outside entrance.
More people flock here than elsewhere, and the less
tramping through corridors they do, the better for them,
the readers, and for the cleanliness of the premises.
When other rooms or passages open out of the delivery
room, a platform slightly raised for the desk will aid
supervision.</p>

<p><b>Light.</b> To get a sufficiently central position for delivery
room and strong enough light on desk and catalog,
seems to be, judging by inspection of libraries and plans,
an especially difficult problem; but it should not be
insoluble to a clever librarian and a bright architect.</p>

<p>The English plans do not help us much with ideas,
for their system is herein different from ours. “Fewer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
people go to the lending department than to the reading
room,” says Duff-Brown,<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> while with most of our American
libraries all readers get to these rooms through or
past the delivery room. And in a “barrier lending library,”
as Champneys calls it, the counter is much
longer than we use, even if there is no “indicator” to
elongate it.</p>

<p>As the size, location and relative connections of the
delivery-room largely determine the convenience of the
whole building, the shape, capacity and practicableness
of the delivery desk determine the excellence of
this department. See <a href="#Page_348">p. 348</a>.</p>

<p>Here the practical and ingenious librarian has his
best chance in planning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span></p>

<h4 id="subhead-127">Janitor</h4>

<p>The janitor in any library has important functions.
In the smallest he is the only assistant, and can be of
great service to the lone librarian in service, supervision
and in substitution when she is away. In a library of
any size he is housekeeper, not only assisting in handling
books, but running the heating and lighting systems,
superintending or performing all services of cleanliness,
and often acting as special policeman in preserving order.
He deserves a room of his own, even if it be a simple
one in the basement. In large libraries he has a small
residence suite, and is always on the premises as day
janitor and night watchman. See Bostwick, p. 284,
where he advises janitor’s private residence in all libraries
except very small ones. But are janitor’s families
always germane? I should say, only in very large libraries
is it best to provide a janitor’s residence suite in the
building. But in most libraries he has a home elsewhere,
with only an office in the library. In this case
he needs for himself only a table, tool bench, chairs, a
closet for clothes and brooms, a box for tools, and a
snug toilet room.</p>

<p><b>Packing room.</b> Winsor<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> assigns this room to the
basement, “a large hall, with raised platform in the
center for superintendent, with stalls about the walls
for successive processes, with rails running past them
for book trucks.” But most of the processes he describes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
are now prosecuted near the catalog room or suite.
The packing room is located in some convenient part of
the basement, directly under the other administration
rooms, with which it has direct communication by tubes
and lifts. It should have a separate door to a carriageway,
and in large libraries can have a package platform
and freight doors opening out of it, for loading and
unloading boxes of books.</p>

<p>The uses assigned to this room are generally packing
and unpacking, central provisions for cleaning, light
repairing of books and furniture, laying out for binder.
Its furniture can be scant and simple: work tables or
trestles against any free wall space, trucks, an adjacent
closet or two, good windows on one or two sides, for light
on processes, some shelves for laying out books in transit.</p>

<p><b>Cleaning.</b> Here is a good central place for the
paraphernalia of these operations, brushes, pails, cloths,
and the like, not forgetting closets for the clothes of the
scrubwoman.</p>

<p>See Bostwick on Cleaning.<a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span></p>

<h4 id="subhead-128">Binding and Printing</h4>

<p><b>Bindery.</b> Every library has to have a lot of repairing
and binding done. Is it better to have your own
plant on the premises or to contract to have it done
elsewhere? E. R. N. Matthews<a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> says that out of forty-seven
English libraries he inquired of, twelve had binderies.
He endorses the idea, having installed one at
a new branch for his own system, in a separate building,
with plant he enumerates, bought second hand for £50.</p>

<p>In small libraries it is easy to decide; nothing except
simple repairing by the janitor can be done at home.
Whatever has to be done from time to time can be sent
out on contract. In view of the space taken up, the
bulky and noisy machinery, the cost and trouble of
selecting and storing stock, the danger of labor troubles
and fires, and the bad odors of glues, the ownership of a
bindery would naturally be put off until it can be proved
to be a great economy in time and money. Champneys,<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a>
following Duff-Brown,<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> says that “Binderies are not required
except in very large libraries.” I say from considerable
business experience, save yourself cost, risk
and trouble, by not trying the experiment.</p>

<p>If you must have a bindery, a good place for it is the
basement, in or next to the packing room, where books
are being handled. Some authorities suggest the attic,
but it seems to me that the quiet and top light of the
upper floor make it too valuable for finer purposes, to be
spared for such “base mechanical use.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span></p>

<p>Every sizable library ought to have at least a bindery
repair-room or nook for repair work in the janitor’s or
packing room, where one or two skilled workmen or
girls of your own staff can do light repairs, pasting and
the like. But this is the limit of work in the building
wisdom requires you to provide for.</p>

<p>See M. W. Straight, “Repairing Books.”<a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a></p>

<p>See E. R. N. Matthews, “Library Binderies.”<a id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a></p>

<p>See H. T. Coutts, “The Home Bindery.”<a id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a></p>

<p><b>Printery.</b> So with printing. Very large libraries
may have a complete outfit, but, as Bostwick says,<a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a>
“a library of any size may well have a small outfit for
printing letter heads, envelopes, cards, pockets, book
plates, etc.” This may be in the same room as the
bindery down below. If to be installed for the first
time, and the librarian has not had personal experience,
a practical binder and printer should be consulted as to
space, light and fittings required.</p>

<p>Miss Marvin writes to me, “I have liked a suggestion
made by Mr. Doyle, architect of the Portland (Or.) Public
Library. He feels it a mistake to plan for all administrative
work and storage of books not frequently used,
in the central library, built on expensive land with no
space to spare.... I have never known a public
library practical enough to build a warehouse on inexpensive
land near the edge of a town for the storage of
books, or the receipt of books on which clerical work is
to be done before distribution to the branches....
These details for school collections, traveling library
collections, and other clerical work, as well as binding,
repair, etc., had just as well be removed from the central
library, and the space there used for reading rooms and
necessary offices.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span></p>

<p>[See Matthews’ mention of a central bindery in a
branch in England.]</p>

<p>This is worth considering, provided the need of
removal is urgent. There are administrative questions
to be considered, however, besides cost of land or construction;
such as service, care, carriage, etc.</p>

<p>The larger the building, and the more stories, the more
opportunity there is, by exercising economy of space
and cleverness of arrangement, to find room there for
these distributing functions, which are easiest controlled
under central supervision and close to the books.</p>

<p>One thing I would never do—consent to such removal
until every superfluous architectural area, in
vestibules, corridors, staircases, etc., had been eliminated,
and the building reduced to its lowest possible denomination
for necessary central work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span></p>

<h4 id="subhead-129">Room for Service of Branches</h4>

<p>In large libraries, room must be provided for laying
out, shipping and receiving books for branches, deliveries,
traveling libraries and all other kinds of outside activities.
How much space these may require may be
inferred from the fact that the Travelling Library office
of the New York Public Library has a stock of fifty
thousand volumes and seventeen employees.</p>

<p>It should either have direct shipping doors, or should
open into the packing room, with good access to the
shipping facilities there.</p>

<p>Besides tables, desks and shelving for the general
use of superintendent and clerks, with corner for telephones
to the branches, etc., and to other departments
of the main library, there will have to be bins for such
dispatch service. As the books come here from the
stack, nearness to it, or some form of mechanical connection
with it, will save much time. Here, as in so
many other departments of every new large library, is
opportunity for individual planning.</p>

<h4 id="subhead-130">Comfort Rooms</h4>

<p><b>Rest and Lunch.</b> In England always, and oftener
here than formerly, even in small libraries, a room or
rooms are provided for the relaxation of the staff.
“Especially for women, humanity and a wise economy
prompt comfortable rest rooms, as they are not as
uniformly in robust health, and are more subject to
sudden indisposition.”—(<i>Bostwick.</i><a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a>) In view of the
good these can do, in refreshing attendants, and keeping
them in the building, as well as the fact that such rooms
can be tucked into space not really needed for anything
else, and also because of the moderate expense of fitting
them up, it seems a great pity to cut them out of plans,
as I have known building committees to do from false
ideas of economy. A room for rest and lunching, a tiny
“kitchenette” adjoining, with gas stove, one room if
you can for men, another for women; or in smaller libraries
a common room for a library mess, will do a deal
toward infusing an <i>esprit de corps</i> into the whole staff.
A timely cup of tea will soothe the nerves and stimulate
the jaded to renewed vigor. This is so much a matter
of housekeeping that the advice of the ladies of the corps
can wisely be taken as to equipment, including store
closet. They can be trusted to get everything needed
into little space, at little cost.</p>

<p>See article in <i>Public Libraries</i><a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> on “Comfort in a
Library,” where it is said a room 6×6 can be made
to serve.</p>

<p><b>Wraps.</b> As far as clothes are concerned, the staff
have got to be given cleanly and satisfactory places to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
leave hats, coats, umbrellas and overshoes during working
hours. These should be in the basement, or some
place not so far through corridors as to have much tracking
of mud. If they can be afforded, ventilated wardrobe
cupboards, with a shelf above low enough to hold the
prevalent style of ladies’ hats, a box below for rubbers,
and interval enough between for a long wrap or fur
coat, should be provided for each person; private cupboards
for all private rooms; staff cupboards in the
staff rest room, each one with lock.</p>

<p>For the public, a convenient umbrella stand (automatic
locks will improve it), and rubber pigeon-holes
near the entrance will prevent dripping around. There
are various makeshifts—racks for hats under chairs,
coat rails behind chairs, or at the end of tables (see
Tables, <a href="#Page_344">p. 344</a>, and Chairs, <a href="#Page_346">p. 346</a>) or hat racks in passages,
and the like. In the larger libraries, where coat
rooms become necessary, they can be slipped into
narrow rooms under staircases or in passages near the
vestibule.</p>

<p>“Every reading room should have hooks or trees for
coats and hats, and stands for umbrellas.”—<i>Eastman.</i></p>

<p>“In small libraries coat rooms should open from the
delivery room, overlooked from the desk.”—<i>Marvin.</i><a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a></p>

<p><b>Lavatory.</b> Need of frequent wash bowls on all floors
has been spoken of elsewhere. A common lavatory for
women and a separate one for men, open both to public
and staff, is a great convenience, and may render fewer
separate wash bowls necessary,—a desideratum as far
as cost goes, for plumbing is a great expense, and part
of planning is to concentrate and reduce to a minimum
“stacks” of plumbing. For this reason water fixtures
on separate floors should be superimposed rather than
scattered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span></p>

<h4 id="subhead-131">Sanitary Facilities</h4>

<p>These must be furnished separately for men and
women of the staff, but whether or not they need be provided
for the public is a question both here and in
England. Miss Marvin<a id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> is positive that public toilet
rooms are a great nuisance, and should be omitted
always, at all events from the main floor. Burgoyne<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a>
reports opinion divided, but thinks them advisable where
a separate attendant can be afforded. Is it not mainly
a matter of size and location? Large libraries must
provide them for large throngs; libraries of medium size
must offer some refuge for serious readers who have to
spend many hours over their books; small local or
branch libraries, whose users live not so far away, may
omit them. The trouble and expense are against them,
convenience and health are in their favor. If the park
board or public health authorities will provide them
somewhere near, the problem is solved. Where they can
be avoided in small libraries, and where children throng,
much trouble of personal oversight will be saved. If
they must be installed, here is certainly a problem to
be solved in convenience, separation, and casual supervision
of entrances and exits.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span></p>

<h4 id="subhead-132">Vehicles</h4>

<p>Automobiles can be ranged at the curb in front of
the library; they lock or care for themselves. Hitching-posts
in rural districts will tether horses. Bicycles, not
so much in evidence as they were once, may be left in
racks in front, or in some place provided for them in
lobby, or inside the rear entrance in the cellar.</p>

<p>In a large library, with courtyard, or even without,
an inclined approach to the basement is possible. In
St. Louis it runs from one street corner, down along a
side of the building, then turns into an open underground
entrance to the basement. Such a passageway
takes from the street the library’s vehicles for branch
service, etc., and if there is space inside, and the surrounding
streets are narrow, it might well give safety
for visitor’s vehicles.</p>

<p>Duff-Brown<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> thinks bicycles are best housed outside.
Champneys<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> says, “don’t allow them in corridors.”</p>

<p>In busy thoroughfares of large cities, or, indeed, in
small cities in this age of street Juggernauts, provision
may well be made for safe ingress and egress for decrepit
readers near the curbstones. Some forethought, taken
by architect in conjunction with street-car officials,
would land many users in the new building without
much of the flurry and danger which often hovers over
the approaches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span></p>

<h3 id="subhead-133">PART II<br />
<span class="smaller">BOOK STORAGE</span></h3>

<p>The several rooms will be treated separately, also
different methods of shelving. The phrase “book rooms”
is not used herein as in England, where book store or
book room means only book storage, as distinguished
from staff rooms and reading rooms, but will include all
kinds of shelving, whether used for book storage only or
combined with handling and reading.</p>

<p>In an article on Book-storage by H. Woodbine in
a recent number of The Library Association Record,<a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a>
he states the factors of past development as,—</p>

<ul>
<li>1. Economy of space.</li>
<li>2. Economy of cost.</li>
<li>3. Expansibility.</li>
<li>4. Adjustability.</li>
<li>5. Safety from fire.</li>
<li>6. Protection of books (from pests, dirt, damp, etc.)</li>
<li>7. Convenience in service.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is well to bear all these in mind when planning any
library, though I should put the last first, and add
cleanliness. They would serve as comprehensive tests
of all kinds of shelving, wooden or metal; wall, floor, or
stack. They are such important details in library service
that I will take up the different forms of shelving in
considerable detail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span></p>

<h4 id="subhead-134">Shelving, Generally</h4>

<p>General rules in shelving are: (1) No book should be
above reach of hand from floor. This means about 6½
feet (less in children’s rooms) or 7½ feet to cornice, or
top of top space. Don’t use steps or ladders, they are
obstructive and troublesome to use.</p>

<p>(2) Uprights should not be more than three feet apart,
to avoid sagging, and weight in handling. Somewhat
less is sometimes advised, never more.</p>

<p>(3) All shelves should be of the same measurements
and interchangeable, for obvious reasons, throughout
the library. Unadvised architects are apt to fill nooks
and spaces with shelving to suit. This may not be so
objectionable in fixed shelving, but is fatal with movable
shelves.</p>

<p>(4) Shelving should be movable as well as adjustable.
Private libraries and very small libraries can get along
for a while with fixed shelving, but when books of different
sizes accumulate, and close classification is adopted,
movable shelving is necessary.</p>

<p>(5) Edges and corners of shelves and supports should
be rounded. If hands or books strike sharp edges
roughly, they suffer.</p>

<p>(6) There should be no projections to catch clothing.
Watch this, especially in stacks.</p>

<p>(7) In shelving or supports, do not leave projections
to catch dust. This is often a fault of carved end-uprights.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span></p>

<p>(8) Have both upper and lower shelves accessible and
well lighted for easy inspection. Wherever there is
ample room, use of only the breast-high shelves is more
convenient both for inspection and for handling.</p>

<p>(9) The old-fashioned ledge is not needed, except in a
few instances. It unnecessarily widens the aisle above,
interfering with close storage. Wide books can be
stored elsewhere; and space to lay books down in
handling can be provided near by.</p>

<p>(10) The average dimensions of shelves<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> are well
settled by custom; <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Length</i> (as above), not over three
feet; <i>Depth</i>, eight inches, except for special sizes of
books (see later); <i>Thickness</i>; for wooden shelves, ⅞
inch finished, (1 inch stuff, planed); <i>Interval</i>, Wood or
metal 10 inches (11 inches top to top of wooden shelves)
for octavos and duodecimos, though one advantage of
movable shelves is the possibility of variation if desired
anywhere.</p>

<p>(11) No doors of any kind are used in modern library
bookcases, except where dust is to be excluded from
delicate books, or thieves are to be excluded from rare
books. Doors are an impediment to use.</p>

<p><b>Shelf-bases.</b> To save books in sweeping, a four-inch
solid base is usually provided in all lands of
shelving. In unusually high shelves, this base projects
as a step, but it is unsightly thus, and just so much as it
projects it narrows the aisles and promotes stumbling.</p>

<p>See <i>Fletcher</i>, Public Libraries.<a id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a></p>

<p><b>Fixed or Movable.</b> As stated above, fixed shelving
is somewhat cheaper and more easily made, and will
serve well in very small libraries. In setting up movable
shelving a row of shallow holes an inch apart is bored an
inch from the front and from the rear edge of the inside
uprights. To support the shelves, projecting pegs of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span>
various kinds are inserted in these holes at any desired
intervals. There are several patents, the most popular
one being a metallic pin with shoulder, which may be
turned over for slight alteration of interval. Plain picture
screw-eyes, with the eyes turned flat, are favorites
in some libraries, and are cheap. Accuracy is necessary
in boring the holes, and experiments are advisable as to
the fit and steadiness of the pins, so that the shelves will
not be liable to tip or fall.</p>

<p><b>Wood or Metal.</b> In small libraries there is no need
at all of metallic cases or shelving and it is absurdly
wasteful to buy them too soon. Wooden shelving is
cheaper, easier put up by local builders, and though it
may occupy a trifle more space, is serviceable and strong
enough until superimposed stories of shelving become
necessary. Even two stories of wood can be easily
managed. If you want more than two stories to use as a
stack, you must have iron or steel. There are, of
course, many advantages in metal when you have to
come to it, though it is more costly. It saves a certain
amount of space; it does not obstruct light or ventilation
so much as thicker material; it is more fireproof;
shelves are more easily moved.</p>

<p>Metal in stacks is universal in larger libraries in
America, so is wood in small libraries. In England
wood seems much more used in large libraries than
with us.</p>

<p>Hard wood is not necessary for shelving, the cheaper
kinds of soft wood will do, and are easier set. No backing
is necessary in any form of book case, except
as a brace, or for appearance, or against a brick or
stone wall.</p>

<p>“Use no paint, but varnish and rub thoroughly.”—<i>Poole.</i><a id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span></p>

<p>“Few village libraries need spend money for steel
shelving. It costs twice as much as oak; four or five
times as much as some woods. Wooden cases are movable,
steel not; with wood you can shift and add. You
would not prefer steel in your home.... For libraries
of less than 30,000 volumes, wood is better.”—<i>Eastman.</i><a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a></p>

<p>In planning small buildings do not let manufacturers
lead you into the expense of putting in metallic shelving
or fixtures. Wood answers every need as well, and
often better, and is much cheaper. Miss Marvin says,<a id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a>
“No stack should be included in a building costing under
$20,000.” I should put the limit higher, and say “No
metallic stack is either necessary or desirable while
wooden wall shelving and floor shelving will hold the
books in the library.”</p>

<p><b>Ledges.</b> In the early wooden shelving for libraries,
ledges, “counter ledges,” so called from their being the
height of an ordinary “counter,” were considered essential.
Dewey<a id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> says: “These have a double use. They
give a greatly needed shelf on which readers may lay
books for consultation or while reaching others, and for
the pages in getting and putting back books.”</p>

<p>These ledges do not appear so much now in floor-cases
or stacks. They still survive, however, in wall-shelving.</p>

<p>But they served serious needs in handling books and
have been seriously missed since they disappeared from
use. See an article on a proposed substitute in stacks,
under the title “Carrel,” p. 286, later. This feature might
also be used with wooden floor-cases when lighted by
“true stack windows.”</p>

<p><b>Labels</b>, <b>Pins</b>, see articles in Library Notes.<a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span></p>

<p><b>Head-room.</b> It is best not to build floor-shelving,
even in low rooms, quite up to the ceiling, but to leave
some room over the tops of the books on the top shelf
for free ventilation. But Dewey said at the 1887 Conference,
“Why not leave it out—use all space for
shelving, with artificial ventilation?” This might apply
to the head-room usually left at the top of stack rooms.
But how about heat? And in most libraries there is no
effective artificial ventilation or forced draft. And in
many rooms outside the stack, it will not be necessary
to shelve quite up to the roof.</p>

<p><b>Shelves High or Low.</b> The rule is, as stated, 7½
feet in height. In many old libraries, and in a few newer
ones, higher cases are used, in order not to waste upper
space in a high room, wherever this space is not
needed for ventilation or diffused light. This is very
unfortunate in inspecting or handling the books. To
overcome the difficulty of seeing and getting at the
highest shelves, various forms of steps or step ladders,
or base steps and high handles on the uprights are in use
which can be investigated and adopted when occasion requires,
as it never should arise in a new building. If such
shelving is inherited, or must be used, it would be best
to use these shelves, too high to reach by hand, for
storing sets of books or magazines rarely wanted. Or
a gallery can be built half way up to avoid the awkward
use of ladders.</p>

<p>As books to be inspected are best nearly opposite the
eye of a reader standing or sitting, live books would
better not be stored on lower shelves in any open-access
cases. These shelves nearest the floor might be
used, therefore, for similar sets not often needed.</p>

<p>Miss Marvin<a id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> advises uniform height for wall-shelving
all over the building.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span></p>

<p>Low bookcases, “dwarf bookcases,” both in wall-shelving
or floor cases, are often used, for different reasons,
especially to serve as partitions, and have not the
disadvantages of cases too high. In floor-cases, the top
can be used as a convenient ledge. In this form, low
cases can be set anywhere on the floor without seriously
obstructing light, ventilation, or supervision, and low
cases can be used against the wall when high-set windows
are needed to throw light further across a room.</p>

<p><b>Unusual Shapes or Sizes of Books.</b> Minimos,
(sizes under the ordinary duodecimos) are so unusual
that they can be shelved at the ordinary intervals;
and if a set or lot of such small books come together,
movable shelves can be closed together, without much
waste of depth (or by doubling back, with no waste).</p>

<p>Folios and quartos occur in all libraries, in the smallest
as books of reference, like dictionaries and atlases; in
larger libraries they may come anywhere. Formerly,
the lower shelves in all cases were made wider, with a
ledge above, but this made the aisles so much wider
than was necessary for shoulder room above, that ledges
are not now much used in floor-shelving or stacks.
Instead, special shelving is provided not far off on each
floor, and slips or dummies put on the shelves to indicate
where the larger volumes ought to come in the regular
classification, and where they can be found when wanted.</p>

<p>This special shelving is often put along the walls,
but in late stacks I have found it convenient at both
ends of each story. The necessary ledge can be widened
without much sacrifice of space, into a shelf at table
height, which can be put to many purposes, part of it
at one end being cut into to give room for the stack
stairs, which usually rob either books or users of more
room elsewhere. In other rooms, with wooden shelving,
there is almost always a convenient recess or end, where<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span>
quarto and folio shelving can be put without crowding the
other cases. Indeed, when designing a library building,
one thing to watch for is, where such shelving can be
stowed away near at hand, with the most economy of
space. In floor-cases, wooden or metal, occasional
large books can be laid across two adjoining shelves.</p>

<p>As to dimensions, Mr. Poole’s recommendations in
1876<a id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> still hold good: a ledge about 34 inches high, with
two shelves below, 18 and 16 inches high for folios, 16 inches
deep, and as many shelves as the case will allow above,
12 inches high and 10½ inches deep. Burgoyne says,<a id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a>
21 inches high for folios, 13 high for quartos. These are
extreme. Dewey recommends 12 × 10 inches for quartos;
for folios just double octavo measurement; large folios
to be laid on their sides.<a id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a></p>

<p>If movable shelving is installed, it will be possible
to shelve the exceptional books upright or flat, as their
size and character requires.</p>

<p>Burgoyne<a id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> advises padding flat folio shelves. The
British Museum uses cowhide; other libraries, canton
flannel (bad) with falls.</p>

<p>Elephant folios will require special roller shelves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span></p>

<h4 id="subhead-135">Shelves in Reading Rooms</h4>

<p>“The books most used should be stored around the
walls of the reading-rooms.”—(<i>Miss Marvin.</i><a id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a>) This has
been a common custom, but Mr. Dana has suggested
that such shelving is out of place in reading-rooms.
So H. T. Hare, in 8 The Lib. Asso. Record:<a id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> “The placing
of books around the walls wastes floor space otherwise
available for readers.” In this opinion I concur,<a id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> for the
double reason that it bars out just so many readers,
and also it necessitates movement which interferes with
serious reading. As to the former objection, take a
room 30 × 40 with a perimeter of 140 feet, less say 10
feet for doors, 130 feet net: If this is shelved all around,
the shelving with the usual ledge, and the three feet space
in front of it needed for access, inspection and passing,
four feet in all, will take up 456 square feet, out of a
total area of 1200, nearly two-fifths. Without the wall
shelving, the room would hold tables for that many more
readers—the use for which it is intended. As to the
latter consideration, to get at the books every attendant
fetching or returning or cleaning them, every reader
consulting them, has to pass before or beside or close
back of some other reader who is trying to abstract
himself at a desk. If stored somewhere else in floor
shelving or in a stack close by, the books would not
take up more space, would be more accessible, and less
in the way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span></p>

<p>If a serious reading room can open directly into an
open-shelf floor of a stack, no wall-shelving will be
necessary.</p>

<p>The second objection would, of course, not apply so
much to rooms for light reading where more or less
motion and noise are expected, and less serious study
is usual.</p>

<p><b>Class and Study Rooms.</b> Here wall-shelving for
reference books permanently or class books temporarily
required, and sometimes floor shelving also, or a combination
of wall-shelving with occasional projecting
cases, like shallow alcoves, opposite good light, will be
required. The purpose of each room defines its needs in
arrangement and shelving, as also in staff-rooms and
all special rooms. In libraries of sufficient size, each
such room should have telephone connection with the
staff, and if possible separate lifts or corridor railway
service.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span></p>

<h4 id="subhead-136">Wall-Shelving</h4>

<p>The earliest book storage was in cupboards or alcoves,
the latest is in floor cases, but the persistent form between
and even now is that of shelving around the walls of
rooms. Mr. Dana and I object to it around reading
rooms, but it now prevails, and perhaps it will still
prevail even there. Certainly it will always be serviceable
in most of the rooms of a small or large library.
It was formerly continued even in combination with
floor-cases or stacks, but it is vanishing from such book
rooms to maintain its position sturdily wherever floors
are not for shelves, but for tables.</p>

<p>In this form, the old-fashioned shelf-ledge survives,
with folio or quarto shelving, or sometimes cupboards
or bins below, and narrower octavo shelving above.
The ledge is found serviceable in temporary examination
of books and for resting them in transit.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Every available foot of wall space should be utilized
for shelving, between the windows and under the
windows.”—<i>Marvin.</i><a id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> [But not unless light comes
from the other side. See below. And where there is
steam heat, the space under the windows is best for
radiators.]</p>

</div>

<p>Wall-shelving ought always to be opposite and not
next to windows, because direct light in the eyes blinds
the reader so that he cannot distinguish the books.
But if light comes from both sides of the room, both
sides can have wall cases.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span></p>

<p><b>Closed Cases.</b> In private libraries and in some rare
book collections in public libraries, bookcases have locked
sliding doors, either glazed or with strong wire mesh
(for ventilation), too small a mesh to slip books through.</p>

<p>It is better to back wall-shelving with wood whenever
placed against brick or stone walls, to protect the books
from damp and stain.</p>

<p>I have known buildings where the architect put a
dado of expensive wood around rooms where wall-shelving
was to be put up at once or was sure to come soon.
This was, of course, a willful waste, as plain sheathing,
to serve as a back for the shelving, would have been far
better.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span></p>

<h4 id="subhead-137">Floor-Cases</h4>

<p>Floor-cases, as we use them, first appeared apparently
in Leyden about A.D. 1600.<a id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> Their use in America can
be traced to the pressure for space in the old libraries,
just before the birth of the stack, which is only floor-cases
built up into stories. As the term “floor-case” is
used, it covers all bookcases set out from the wall across
the floors, usually in parallel rows perpendicular to the
windows, but sometimes radial or irregular. The cases
are always double, back to back, their dimensions in
each front being just those of wall-cases. The backs
are usually open for light and ventilation, but are sometimes
wired or wainscoted with wood. If backs are
not used in floor-cases, some bracing is needed to make
them rigid. The aisles between vary in width from
three feet for service to six feet for open access, though
service is possible in narrower spaces than three feet, and
open access, with good light, does not absolutely require
six. It is recommended by the authorities that cases
should not exceed fifteen feet in length. Whenever longer
rows are wanted, cross aisles at about that interval
should interrupt, so that an attendant or reader should
not have to walk too far if he needs to get quickly to the
other side of a case.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span></p>

<h4 id="subhead-138">Radial Cases</h4>

<p>“In small libraries and branches, supervision is
ensured by placing floor-cases as radii of a semi-circle
whose centre is the desk.”—<i>Bostwick.</i><a id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a></p>

<p>Duff-Brown<a id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> says that this method of shelving
secures oversight and ease of working.</p>

<p>The advantages and disadvantages of this arrangement
are well summed up by Eastman,<a id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> who thinks it
of doubtful value.</p>

<p>In small libraries, when set symmetrically in a true
semi-circle, radial or concentric cases certainly have a
pleasing effect. The building costs more, either in semi-circular
or octagonal form, than in rectangular (more
in stone or brick than in wood), and there is certainly
waste of space in the widening of the wedge-shaped
intervals, which, however, can be partially utilized by
tables or short intervening floor-cases at their widest
part.</p>

<p>This radial shelving has invariably, I believe, been
built on the rear of the building. In many lots it has
occurred to me that putting it in front, or on one side
toward a street, could be made an agreeable feature, and
would do more than any other thing could do toward
attracting passers-by, and thus “advertising” the
library far more effectively than many publicity schemes
recently suggested.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span></p>

<p>As to supervision, I have seen in a recent discussion
the reminder that one person blocks the narrow end
toward the desk, and effectively hides disorder, mutilation,
or theft beyond.</p>

<p>Sometimes the projection from the building is rectangular,
and the shelving concentric, an arrangement likely
to cast shadows. In some American libraries long rows
of slanting floor-cases, not true radii, point toward the
desk. So good a librarian as Mr. Wellman of Springfield,
has adopted this arrangement in a large rectangular
room. See also the Law Library at Rochester, N. Y.
But does not this arrangement block light rather than
facilitate its penetration into the room to the lowest
shelves? I should doubt whether the advantage in
supervision would counterbalance this interference and
the waste of space. Champneys<a id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> (an architect) thinks
there may be danger of “overestimating police methods.”
It seems to me that in sizeable rectangular rooms, supervised
entrance and exit at the desk, with rectangular
arrangement of the shelves either perpendicular to the
deskline or even athwart the room, thus trusting the
public, would be better.</p>

<p>In small libraries, as in branches, this arrangement
is worth considering, but should not be adopted, it seems
to me, without very careful balancing of arguments <i>pro</i>
and <i>con</i>. Economy in construction and space and difficulties
in enlargement are against; many considerations
of cheerfulness and usefulness are in its favor. Where
the library is so small, however, that only three or
four floor-cases will hold all its stock of books, these in
a rectangular projection back of the desk, will give
most of the effect of the radial form, rather cheaper.</p>

<p>Librarians who have operated both forms could give
points to any one in doubt, and many floor plans, English<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>
as well as American, with many interior views, are
accessible to show different arrangements.</p>

<p>If adopted, it seems to me that the semi-circular plan
with true radii, is better than the octagonal or rectangular
walls, with obliquely placed floor cases. These may be
arranged for good supervision, but their slant disturbs
one’s sense of symmetry. Besides, the basement beneath
may be devoted to a class or lecture room, for which
such a semi-circular shape gives good light and cheerful
effect.</p>

<p>The semi-circular plan has been adopted for alcove
rooms in many places, such as the Library of Parliament
at Ottawa, Princeton University, and so on, but these
do not have radiating cases and need not be discussed
here.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span></p>

<h4 id="subhead-139">Shelf Capacity</h4>

<p>To calculate shelf capacity, it has been usual to take
ten volumes to a running foot, a figure which has been
verified in some libraries. But books vary in thickness
in different kinds of literature, and the exigencies of
growth require gaps to be left in closely-classified
libraries, at the end of each subject. These facts have
tended to vary estimates, which do not now agree.
In “Library Rooms and Building,” I said,<a id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> “For these
reasons, it is prudent to calculate about eight volumes
to a foot for octavos and under, and still less, say five
volumes to the foot, for reference books, law books,
medical books, and other bulky literature.” I have
seen no reason since to change these figures for estimates,
though planners should bear in mind the different classes
and sizes of books to be stored in each room or on each
case.</p>

<p>The English authorities still set the average number
of volumes to a linear shelf foot rather higher, eight and
a half to nine and a half for lending libraries or fiction
shelves. See also, “Stack Capacity.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span></p>

<h4 id="subhead-140">The Poole Plan</h4>

<p>This seems to be the best place to allude to the scheme
which Dr. Poole proposed as an alternative of the stack.
As Fletcher says, the principal objection to the stack
plan was as to opportunities for readers to get at the
books on the shelves. To place readers and books in
close contact, Dr. Poole proposed dividing a building
mainly into large rooms, in each of which readers should
have tables near the windows, while opposite the windows
the inner portion of the room should have floor-cases
filled with some special class of books. He got the chance
to embody this idea in the building of the Newberry
Library of Chicago. As far as I know this plan has not
been adopted elsewhere as a whole, but every large
library since built has included rooms arranged more or
less on this plan, which is indeed the idea of the department
library in a college; or special rooms, such as Art
and Patents, in a public library. So far as Dr. Poole
advocated his plan he furthered library efficiency and
should deserve credit and remembrance.</p>

<p>“In the Providence Public Library, for instance, two-fifths
of the books are shelved outside of the stack.”—<i>Foster.</i><a id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a></p>

<p>But the stack plan has “won out” as a system, and
has established itself as a factor in modern American
library building. Further changes, developments and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span>
improvements are doubtless coming, but so far as
administration and architecture are concerned, the
stack must be reckoned as the distinctive difference
between libraries and other buildings.</p>

<p>See description and criticism of the Poole plan, with
vindication of the stack system, in B. R. Green’s article
in the Library Journal.<a id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a></p>

<p>Dr. Poole was a sturdy fighter in his day, but he
was an excellent, practical librarian. If he had lived
to see the stack as now improved, and had also seen
its combination with the department library or special
library in large buildings, I think he would have conceded
the merits of the new system.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span></p>

<h4 id="subhead-141">Stacks</h4>

<p><b>Generally.</b> These have been adopted in this country,
in nearly all libraries which have got beyond the size
where floor cases will serve. They come into use with
us much earlier in the growth of a library than in
England, where they seem not so much in favor.</p>

<p>The notion of the stack was first suggested by the
modern revival in America, about 1850, of the floor-case
system, exemplified two hundred years before in the
Leyden University Library. The first modern mention
of this system I can find is Winsor’s description (1876)<a id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a>
of the arrangement of his new Roxbury branch of the
Boston Public Library. In his description of the floor-cases,
then only floor-cases, he suggested the idea of
providing for growth another story of superincumbent
cases, apparently of wood, with “dumb-waiters,” and
“spiral stairs.” In 1877, Winsor outlined plans for a
similar shelving of several stories with iron framework
and iron floors.<a id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> About this time (Winsor left the
Boston Public Library and went to Harvard as librarian
in 1877), the first metallic stack (with wooden shelves)
was developed and installed in the addition to the
Harvard library building. The idea seems due to
Winsor, the practical embodiment of it in full stack form
to the architects Ware and Van Brunt. The latter
described it soon after in the Library Journal,<a id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> saying,
“I am in part responsible for it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span></p>

<p>This pregnant idea, which, as developed, has done
more to change library administration and library architecture
than any other device, was evidently born in
the brains of a librarian as a result of his thought and
experiments, and developed into practicability by good
architects, as all great problems of library building
should be worked out. The original stack contained all
essential ideas, but great improvements in details have
since then been effected by librarians, architects, and
constructors.</p>

<p>Stacks were at first stoutly opposed by many librarians.
As described by Fletcher,<a id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> “The stack, as usually built,
consists of a series of iron bookcases [<i>floor cases</i>] running
from bottom to top of a high room divided at intervals
of about seven feet [7½] by light [<i>iron</i>] openwork or
glass floors [<i>decks</i>]. The stack undoubtedly offers the
most compact storage of books with great ease of access
to every part.” He then enumerates the objections to
the stack, the principal of which he thinks is, “little or
no provision can be made for the access of readers to
the shelves, the idea of the stack being that of a place to
keep the books when not in use.”</p>

<p>Since the first stack was installed at Harvard, remarkably
serviceable even then as a new idea, some of our
most inventive genius has been constantly at work in
trying to perfect the advantages of the system, and overcome
its acknowledged defects. Construction, ventilation,
heating, lighting, communications, ease of operation,
have been gradually improved, and recently Dr. Poole’s
and Mr. Fletcher’s principal objection, difficulty of use
by readers, has been so greatly overcome that a later
chapter has been devoted to this subject. There are
several good patent stacks in the market, which
deserve study and a chance to submit bids in every new
building project, large or small.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span></p>

<p>The best method of planning is for the librarian to
calculate how many volumes he will have to provide for,
and how large a stack he needs (floor area, and number
of “decks”); to lay out, with the assistance of the architect,
a floor plan for one story, with the number and width
of gangways he wants, and a specification of stairways,
lifts, folio-shelving, and other peculiarities.</p>

<p>It is better not to wait for working drawings and
specifications for main building, or even for the stack
shell (or building), but to ask for two bids for a stack
of size described, one for the cheapest form and material
each maker can supply, and another for the best form
he would recommend, with his cheapest price for that.
This alternative is suggested, because each make claims
certain advantages over the other, which might overbalance
a difference in price. The invitation to bid should
reserve the right “to reject any bid for cause,” and the final
decision should be reserved for the building committee,
under recommendation of librarian and architect. The considerations
for determination can be: cost, strength, lightness,
compactness, adjustability, cleanliness (including lack
of projections to catch dust); convenience of stairs, lifts,
floors; details of heating and lighting; and pleasing design.</p>

<p>After the bid has been assigned, and before the makers
have begun on construction, I advise calling their expert
into consultation, and asking him if he can suggest any
change or improvement in any point which will increase
the usefulness of the stack, without increasing its cost.
There is such a keen competition between stack builders,
that any of them would welcome such a conference, in
the hope of getting ideas from librarian or architect
which might help him improve his patent.</p>

<p>The stack thus bid for is to be self-supporting, deriving
its solidity from its own uprights, without depending
in any degree on the shell, with which the architect will
only cover it and protect it from the weather.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span></p>

<p><b>Location.</b> A stack may be installed inside the
building; for instance, all along the rear,<a id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> or side or front.
A small stack is often a feature of a large department
room. But generally it occupies an ell or wing of the
building, of light construction, projecting from the rear,
or from one side.</p>

<p>Where the building must face a noisy street there
seems to be no reason why the stack, rather than reading
rooms, should not be located there. Why could it not be
designed, even if “true stack windows” would make it look
like an organ front, as a distinctive architectural feature?</p>

<p>“The stack may be as refreshing a problem for the
hard-witted architect to struggle with as he is liable to
meet. It may be that the reading rooms will be within,
shut off from every noise, and the stack arranged along
the exterior.”—<i>Russell Sturgis.</i><a id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a></p>

<p>The reading room is now often put just over the
stack, as a top-story, separated from it by a solid floor,
but connected with it by service tubes, telephones and
lifts. But in colleges, is it not better to use such a
location for seminar rooms, and in many libraries
could it not be used as part of an exhibition and special
library or special study floor?</p>

<p id="subhead-142"><b>The Stack Shell.</b> That is to say, the addition in
which the stack is housed. As has been said, it usually
projects from the rear (but sometimes from the side) of
the main building, as an ell or wing. It can be of
lighter, simpler and plainer construction than the rest,
for it needs no other strength than is necessary to support
its own walls and roof. Indeed, it has not yet been
the victim of architectural ostentation. On the exterior,
true stack windows usually run up and down the whole
height, although they may be interrupted by cross sections
at the level of the floors or decks, or rather just above them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span></p>

<p>From recent experiments I have made in a stack, I
am led to think that here, as elsewhere, top light from
windows is ten times more valuable for penetration
than bottom light, hence such a cross-section of wall,
about a foot wide, if it has any binding power, strengthens
the wall, gives space inside for heating pipes, or looks
better, would not abstract any illumination from the
interior. Perhaps, however, the piers do not need such
binding. That is a question for the architect, and
depends largely on their construction. If they are re-enforced
by iron or steel T-beams, the piers need not
be massive or be strengthened otherwise.</p>

<p>Some authorities (Champneys,<a id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> for instance) recommend
solid floors every three decks, as guard against
spread of fire, but this extra expense, not needed for
support, seems to me unnecessary as protection.</p>

<p>The material of stacks must be iron, or better, steel,
to support so much weight. The construction, indeed,
is much like that of a “sky scraper,” whose steel frame
stands alone, without help from the walls.</p>

<p id="subhead-143"><b>Use by Readers.</b> It does not seem either possible
or desirable to plan for continuous use of any space in
stacks by readers. The temperature both in summer
and winter is usually not so equable as in other rooms.
The main object of the stack, which is book storage, is
just so much frustrated by surrender of shelf space to
readers. But there is much inconvenience in excluding
them entirely.</p>

<p>It is a hindrance to investigation to have to make
inquiries, or selections, through the medium of an application
at a desk. A large number of serious readers
want to glance at all the books bearing on the point they
are investigating, often to “taste” books by dipping
into them here and there; and to make choice directly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span>
from the shelves, of books they want to examine more
thoroughly or copy from, to be carried to a public
or private reading room and used there undisturbed
at leisure. They want free access to the stack for ten
minutes only at a time, but they want it badly. See
Fletcher.<a id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a></p>

<p>“It is fortunate for those who have the use of a library
if they can be admitted to the shelves and select their
books by actual examination.”—<i>Cutter.</i><a id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a></p>

<p>For this, several devices have been used. One is
to leave the space in stacks next to windows for tables
and chairs, to be used by readers. “Or alcoves on one
side, as in Iowa College.”—(<i>Marvin.</i><a id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a>) A variation of
this takes the form of “cubicles,” little glassed-in rooms
next the windows, as in the new Harvard Law School
stack, or as proposed for the Harvard University
Library. But before using this form generally, it would
be better to calculate, first, how much space this
will abstract from the storage capacity of the stack;
second, how much it affects the penetration of daylight
into the stack; third, how often any one reader will
want to use any one section of the library so long as to
make this arrangement worth while; fifth, the expense
of construction and provision of equivalent stack room
elsewhere; and sixth, the problems of heating and
ventilation, for readers who require reading-room conditions.</p>

<p>Another favorite device is to shorten the outer ends
of ranges of shelves, say by one three-foot section, in
every other case on every floor, where a tiny desk can
be set into the range, with a chair or stool underneath
for the use of a reader. This furnishes room for reading
but <i>pro tanto</i> less space for books.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span></p>

<p><b>Open Access Stacks.</b> Can wider aisles be left in
stacks so that readers may stand well back or stoop to
inspect books, and pass each other easily? Yes, stack
cases five feet “on centres” will allow fairly free movement,
as this means 3-feet-6-inch or even 3-feet-8-inch
aisles. But no such width could well be allowed as is
called for with open-access floor cases, <i>i.e.</i>, six feet clear
between. The present methods of stack construction
would not apparently lend themselves well to wide spaces
on the ground floor and narrow spaces above, because
the uprights would not directly support each other. A
building might have, indeed, two or more different
stacks, one open access for readers, the other close
storage for books, but this seems rather wasteful. Is
there no way to provide, in a stack which will give the
maximum storage, some facility for such inspection and
handling as is needed both for staff and readers?</p>

<p><b>A Suggestion.</b> In reading “Clark’s Use of Books,”
I came across an old expedient of mediæval days which
will give a good name for the device I had already
thought of. (See next section.) His quotation<a id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> is as
follows:—</p>

<p>“In the north Syde, the Cloister was all fynely glazed.
And in every wyndowe iii Pewes or Carrels, where
every one of the old Monks had his carrell, severall by
himselfe, and there studied upon there books. From one
stanchell of a window to another, and in every one was a
deske to lye their bookes on.” “These were devices
to provide a certain amount of privacy for literary
work.”<a id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a></p>

<p id="subhead-144"><b>Carrels.</b> While thinking of this conflict between the
desired use by readers and the close storage which is the
proper use of a stack, I tried to find some wasted space<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span>
which might serve the one use without infringing upon
the other. While searching I noticed that window ledges
were thus wasted. Look through Koch’s floor plans,<a id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a>
or any others, and you will notice that window frames,
usually set midway between the outer and inner surfaces
of the wall, were sometimes set flush with the inner
surface, thus leaving outside a window “stool” nearly
the full width of the wall. But why leave it outside
where it would be only useful for pigeon-roosts or flower-boxes,
neither strictly necessary? Why not set the
window-frame flush with the outer wall and so leave
the whole ledge inside, both sill and stool? In the Salem
Public Library stack, as the architect saw no structural
reason against it, this has been tried. In each stack
window on every floor a thin shelf has been run across,
table high. The setting back allows this shelf to be
twelve inches deep and three feet long without projecting
into the aisle, and without materially interfering with
light. Set a stool near and here is provision, close to
the books, and without cutting into the stack, for just
as many choosers of books as there are windows on
each floor. When no readers need them, here is a
ledge for attendants to use in assembling or dispersing
books.</p>

<p>This device does not suit permanent reading, for
which the stack is not intended,—but why does it
not perfectly meet the needs of casual inspection, and
choice?</p>

<p>It has been gradually tried out. In the John Hay
Memorial Library at Brown, rather narrow window-shelves
were tried; then wider sloping desks at the
Episcopal Theological School; and recently, the wider
Salem carrels, where the windows are set quite flush
with the exterior of the piers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span></p>

<p>There is still an opportunity for experiment and
development. Is such a shelf better, fixed or hinged?
What would be the simplest form of hinging and fastening?
Is it better, in view of its temporary and intermittent
use, to have it at desk height, for a standee?
How thin can it be, and of what wood, cheapest and least
liable to splitting? Might not metal shelves, furnished
with the stack, be better, and about as cheap?</p>

<p>As finally improved with these carrels we could bring
the whole stack back to the narrowest intervals consistent
with moving books, and thus avoid resort to
underground stacks and sliding cases, until much later.</p>

<p>[Webster’s International Dictionary gives only the
spelling “carol,” but the old records call it “carrell.”]</p>

<p>At Durham, the carrels were 2 feet 9 inches wide.
At Gloucester there were twenty carrels, each 4 feet
wide, 6 feet 9 inches high, and 19 inches deep.<a id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a></p>

<p>The modern Salem Public Library carrel is wider
than the one at Durham, and about as high and deep
as those at Gloucester Cathedral.</p>

<p id="subhead-145"><b>Stack Details.</b> <i>Dark Interiors</i> are discussed elsewhere;
having the library built around a stack, to be
lighted by electricity, open to daylight only by way of
the roof, and opening to outer corridors or rooms on
each floor. This is mainly an architectural problem,
though its administrative aspects would have to be
considered by the librarian.</p>

<p><i>Height.</i> The height of each stack floor is generally set
at seven feet to seven and a half. I favor seven and a
half, of the two, so that a tall man need not stoop under
the deck beams and electric bulbs. In order to get the
ground floor of building and stack coterminous, the
lower story of the stack must correspond with that of
the building, which is not usually higher than ten feet.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span>
As it is most convenient to have the basement floors
of stack and building also coterminous, the unusual
height, for this case only, may be accepted, and the
inconveniently high shelves used for some kind of slow
or dead books.</p>

<p>It is usual to leave several feet above the top shelves,
just under the roof, for ventilation.</p>

<p><i>“Broken” floors</i> are used in some libraries, the Massachusetts
State Library, for instance; one stack floor
being three and one-half feet higher and the next one
three and one-half feet lower than the corresponding
building floor, on the idea that it is easier to go up or
down half a flight than a whole flight, for anyone wanting
to get books. But isn’t the average the same? In this
form, the very great convenience of moving books by
trucks is sacrificed, so that the almost universal custom
is to have the ground floor, and every second floor
above, level in the stack with floors in the building,
thus fixing the height of the latter at fourteen or fifteen
feet, except the top floor, which is free, and the basement,
usually determined by other exigencies.</p>

<p>The material used for “decks” may be openwork iron,
marble, or more usually translucent ground glass.</p>

<p>The floor of the stack as well as of the building basement,
is generally cemented, with special provisions for
excluding dampness.</p>

<p><i>Passages.</i> Those running lengthwise may be called
gangways, those across between cases, aisles. The
number of gangways varies with the size and use of the
stack. Although it might be built without a center
gangway, and have one on each side, or only on one side—it
would then be a very narrow stack—the usual
construction is to have a gangway about four feet wide
down the center, and one of less width (just enough to
allow passing around, say two feet,) at each outer end.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span>
But if it is desired to have very close packing, these side
gangways may not be necessary. In building the new
Salem stack, Mr. Jones decided that he could so run the
classification of the books from the center around back
to the center, in every aisle, that there would be little
need of passing around the outer ends, and he could
omit them and so gain that much more for books.</p>

<p>The center gangway may be any width desired, but
should of course be wide enough to serve as thoroughfare
for men, book-trucks, and boxes. Although four feet
seems the average width, it varies from three feet to six
feet in existing libraries. Good, large windows on each
floor should light gangways at the far end.</p>

<p>The length of aisles varies with the width of the stack
building, though limited by the belief that no bookcase
should be more than 15 or 18 feet long, which requires
other gangways at that interval. The width of the
aisles has varied. The original Harvard width, 2 feet
4 inches, appears to be the very narrowest which will
allow passage of two persons, or stooping to the lower
shelves; 2 feet 8 inches is very common; 3 feet is so
roomy that the stack becomes convenient for limited
open-access; while 5 feet “on centers” (3′ 6″ or 8″ aisle)
is the maximum in stacks at present.</p>

<p>Many stacks have wide intervals at the sides of the
“deck” in each aisle—so wide as to have to be wired
to prevent books falling through—“for ventilation,
diffusion of light, and communication,” but such wide
spaces are not needed for light or ventilation, and are
much handier for dropping pencils than for passing
books, so that I prefer wider decks with small rims for
protection, and much narrower spaces along the cases.</p>

<p><i>Stairs.</i> Stack stairs need not be wide, for they are
so short that two people never need to pass. Two feet
wide is enough. When first adopted, circular stairs<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[291]</span>
were used, as supposed to occupy less space, but they
were found to be inconvenient and dangerous, and since
measurement has shown that straight stairs need occupy
no more space, the “cork screws” have been entirely
superseded. Eight-inch risers and 9-inch treads are
recommended by Champneys,<a id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> who thinks, by the way,
2 feet 4 inches the right width, iron with rubber treads
being the material.</p>

<p>Stairs should be put in wherever they will be most
convenient, and where they interfere least with book
storage and passing. One flight certainly should be
next the entrance on each floor, and one flight generally
at the other end. If they be set sideways in the folio
shelving there, which is not always all needed, they
seem to interfere least. (See paragraph on circular or
winding stairs.)</p>

<p><i>Lifts.</i> Light lifts for single books, or few books at a
time, are needed for all stacks (See that title, on <a href="#Page_228">page
228</a>.) In large libraries and high stacks, elevators large
and strong enough to carry trucks and boxes, are also
necessary. For lifts, hand operation will serve, or electricity;
for freight elevators, some sort of power is
better.</p>

<p>Every such carrier should run from basement to top,
with opening on every floor. A speaking tube should
run beside it, with mouthpiece also on each floor.</p>

<p><i>Ledges.</i> (See under Shelving, <a href="#Page_265">p. 265</a>.) As a ledge on
both sides of each case would greatly narrow the aisles
for passage and diminish the capacity for storage, these
have disappeared from the modern stack. Their place
has been taken in some stacks by sliding shelves (to be
drawn out when wanted), which do not appear to be
entirely satisfactory. But the need for some substitute,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span>
for the use of which Dewey speaks, has suggested ledges
for folio shelving on each floor and for the new device
of carrels, which may at least partially replace ledges
without diminishing storage capacity or easy passage.</p>

<p><i>Shelves.</i> The shelving of stacks follows the rules
already described under the title “Shelving,” except as
dimensions are varied by the use of steel, which is less
bulky. Movable shelves also allow more variety in
intervals to suit the average size of books in any part of
the stack. It is usual to maintain the 10-inch height
for intervals between shelves, all over the stack, except
as thus modified here and there to suit exigencies and
except for folio shelving at the ends (or sides) of each
floor.</p>

<p>Different patents offer much choice in stack shelving.
Avoid especially projections, likely to catch dust or
tear clothing or injure books. Test very carefully all
forms of “clutch” or detachable shelves.</p>

<p id="subhead-146"><b>Stack Lighting.</b> <i>Natural.</i> North light is the
best, but the choice is not often open. The location of
the stack is determined usually by other considerations
than aspect. Unless it runs along the rear or side of the
main building; if it projects, that is, it will naturally
have two sides lighted, one of which in any location
would have to be south or west, and thus sunny. If
wired glass is used as a protection against fire it will
be more or less opaque and thus will temper glare.
Shades can, of course, be used on the worst exposure,
and some contrivance can be used, like that at the
Library of Congress, to work all these curtains at once
to save time.</p>

<p>Overhead light will penetrate one glass floor of a
stack fairly well, not more.<a id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"></a>[293]</span></p>

<p>“If daylight is on the whole better and more wholesome,
as it is certainly cheaper than electric light, then
a well windowed stack room is better than a dark one.”—<i>Russell Sturgis.</i><a id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a></p>

<p>Light penetrates stack aisles effectively only about
twenty feet, hence a stack lighted on both sides may be
forty feet wide, plus width of centre aisle.</p>

<p><i>Artificial.</i> The best light is, of course, electricity,
and here the expert of the stack to be installed can give
valuable advice. The question of the location of the
bulbs, their power, their direction (transverse or perpendicular),
their frequency, their wiring, their switches,
such questions must be determined. As a great deal
might depend on the particular structure of the stack,
one bid for the stack, another for the lighting, with
specifications from each bidder, might be invited.</p>

<p>Hand bulbs at the end of cords have not been found
satisfactory. Various devices have been used, but good
systems of fixed lights (bulbs with reflectors and shades),
worked well by means of switches, have been perfected.</p>

<p><i>Reflective Colors.</i> To help diffusion and local effectiveness
of both natural and artificial light, inner walls
and the whole stack would well be painted some agreeable
light tint of enamelled paint. This is a question
of taste for the architect, with approval by librarian
and committee.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[294]</span></p>

<h4 id="subhead-147">Stack Windows</h4>

<p>As stack windows must be high and narrow, they
introduce a new and imperative architectural feature
on the exterior of the stack fronts. The usual form is a
continuous window from foundation to eaves. This
may, however, be broken for a foot up from every floor,
by a cross band of iron or stone, for effect or for any
interior convenience, like continuous hanging of steam
pipes, without real diminution of daylight inside, provided
that the windows run quite to the ceiling in each
deck, to give full top light. If the windows are glazed
with wire glass, they will afford some protection from
outside fire, and being opaque, would temper the glare
of sunlight. Factory ribbed glass is also used, as both
tempering and intensifying daylight.</p>

<p id="subhead-148"><i>True Windows.</i> To give full effect the piers between
windows should be only as thick as the depth of the
double book cases, sixteen inches, and directly opposite
them. They have only to support themselves and
the roof, as the stack floors are independent and self-supporting.
Re-enforcement with a steel T-beam will
render them stiff enough with sixteen inch width, and
even allow flaring from the windows to admit more
light.</p>

<p>With this construction, each window can have the
full width of the aisle it fronts and be so framed and
glazed as not to intercept any light, thus throwing
illumination as far as possible down the aisle, with oblique
rays from the side of the window to the other side of the
aisle, reaching both rows of books to the far end.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[295]</span></p>

<p>This I call a true stack window. In looking over
modern plans, you will see that many libraries have
them as to position, though the entire available width
is not always used.</p>

<p>If you have Clark’s “Care of Books,” see how true
the alcove windows were in the Queen’s College, Cambridge,
library as long ago as A. D. 1472.</p>

<p id="subhead-149"><i>Defective Windows.</i> In other stacks, you will find
windows too short (even if there is a cross band, it should
not be more at the most than eighteen inches in height,
leaving a window on each deck, six feet full down from
the deck above), but oftener windows narrower than the
aisle, giving too little light to reach the inner ends of the
cases. There is no excuse for these. As has been said
above, there is no structural need to build the piers
between windows wider than the book cases inside, and
just so much as they encroach upon the windows they
commit the unpardonable sin of darkening the stack.</p>

<p>Many modern plans show this defect.</p>

<p id="subhead-150"><i>False Windows.</i> By these I mean windows which
outside take the gridiron stack form, but do not come
truly and fully opposite every aisle inside.</p>

<p>“The rear elevation of the New York Public Library
plainly shows that the architects wilfully omitted to
place a window at the end of each aisle. All the beauty
of the elevation will not make good the want of light
in the lower floors of the stack.”—<i>Oscar Bluemner.</i><a id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a></p>

<p>The falsity of this arrangement, which is found in
many modern libraries, lies in using an exterior scheme
which does not meet inside conditions. The excuse is
that sufficient diffused light is provided for the whole
stack. But if this is true (which I cannot concede), any
other equal window area could be used in any other form,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>[296]</span>
which would not give outer promise of inward excellence.
They are only a sham, and can therefore be called false
stack windows.</p>

<p id="subhead-151"><b>Heating.</b> The best form developed for stacks is by
hot water or steam pipes along the walls just above the
floor of each story clear of the books, with coils in the
windows. Overhead pipes are very bad, as they concentrate
heat at the top of each story, where it is most
oppressive to those walking or working below.</p>

<p><b>Ventilation.</b> There should be an air space above
the top shelves in a stack. Good ventilation can
be provided there by end windows and through the
side windows. Some writers have advised sealed windows
so as to be dust proof. In that case some system
of forced draft would have to be installed.</p>

<p>The ventilation of a stack, where use by staff and
public is only intermittent, is perhaps not so important
as that of reading rooms constantly crowded, but the
open construction and height of the stack differentiate
the problem rather than avoid it.</p>

<p id="subhead-152"><b>Underground.</b> In England, Burgoyne says<a id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> four
stories is the rule. But in America, every library builds
its stack, in all dimensions, according to its wants and
space. Four-story stacks are common, but by no means
the limit.</p>

<p>The impending exigencies of storage have not only
brought suggestions of dark stacks in the interior of a
building, but they have already carried stacks under
ground. Even the Bodleian Library in England has
installed a two-story subterranean stack, mechanically
lighted and ventilated, under its front lawn. Plans are
on foot for stacks many floors below ground-level, to
be lighted and aired by electricity. See <a href="#Page_222">p. 222</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"></a>[297]</span></p>

<p><b>Upward.</b> Ten “decks” is the maximum height now,
but why is it not possible to build further up into the
air before we burrow under ground? Are there any
structural difficulties? Would it cost more to have a
“sky-scraper” stack than a dungeon?</p>

<p>It is a question how underground cases will affect the
books. It is claimed that forced draft will avert the
evils of dampness, but Dr. Thwaites reports that he
has found trouble from mould deposited on the backs
of books as the warmer air from the surface above comes
into contact with the cooler walls of the cellar. Would
not books packed in sliding cases, away from the moving
air, be more apt to develop inside rot and insects?</p>

<p>It does not appear to me that cellars for book storage
have got beyond experimental stage. Some years of
test seem needed to prove their perfect availability.</p>

<p id="subhead-153"><b>Stack Towers.</b> B. R. Green says<a id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> “the stack might
be in the center, and rise from the roof as a tower. It
would be a simple thing to make a stack of twenty or
more stories.” Why not? and why not so rise from an
ell, as well as from the center? Why not build it as a
sky-scraper, any number of stories upward, supporting
itself, with a shell plastered on the exterior? The
structural objections would seem no greater in a stack
than an office building. The operating objections are
surely no weightier going up than going down. The
daylight would be better, the dampness less. It might
be easier to flood cellars than towers, in case of fire, but
the certainty of water is even a worse foe to books than
the possibilities of fire.</p>

<p>Why is not here a chance to develop a new type of
architectural beauty? If towers are fine features in
churches and abbeys, why not in libraries? Before
digging catacombs for our books, why not set our inventive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298"></a>[298]</span>
faculties on hanging gardens of literature reached
by elevators like the levels of the Eiffel Tower?</p>

<p id="subhead-154"><b>Capacity.</b> Various ways of calculating capacity
have been suggested, but most of them disregard
the fact that stacks vary in measurement, and only two
whose interior dimensions are exactly alike can be
safely compared.</p>

<p>Capacity of an average stack can be roughly calculated
at twenty volumes to a square foot on each deck.
Thus a 30 × 40 stack, three stories high, will hold about
72,000 vols.</p>

<p>I prefer to calculate the capacity of every new stack
independently, when planning it.</p>

<p>Taking folio shelving separately and adding its figures
in later, I take one floor by itself. It has so many
double cases, such and such length, on each side of the
central gangway. One case 15 or 18 feet long, multiplied
by 2 for the two sides, and 7 or 8 for such shelves
as the librarian thinks he can use, then multiplied by
8 volumes to each foot, will give the “practical capacity”
in volumes for octavos and duodecimos. Multiply by
the number of cases on both sides, plus your calculation
for folios, and you have the capacity of that deck.
Multiply again by number of decks, and you have the
practical capacity of the stack.</p>

<p>If you wish to get the “full capacity,” as it is reported
in many plans, make your volume-multiplier ten instead
of eight, or add twenty-five per cent to your first calculation,
which amounts to the same thing. But eight to
the foot is practically full capacity for closely classified
libraries, where frequent gaps must be left for growth,
at the end of each subject.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>[299]</span></p>

<h4 id="subhead-155">Sliding Cases</h4>

<p>We can wisely borrow from England the “sliding
presses” which Dr. Richard Garnett brought to the
attention of the Library Association of the United Kingdom
at its annual meeting of 1891, having previously
described them in Dewey’s Library Notes and elsewhere
in 1887.</p>

<p>Adapted from the Bethnal Green library in 1886,
they were put on trial in the British Museum in 1887,
and have since been in operation, regarded apparently
as an invention quite as valuable as the stack appears
to us. “I think enough has been said,” to quote Dr.
Garnett’s words, “to convince librarians of the expediency
of taking the sliding-press, or some analogous
contrivance, into account in plans for the enlargement
of old libraries, or the construction of new ones.”</p>

<p>The British Museum press is described as “an additional
bookcase hung in the air from beams or rods projecting
in front of the bookcase it is desired to enlarge,
working by rollers running on metal ribs, and so suspended
as not to touch the ground anywhere.” In
other words, it is a movable bookcase parallel to a fixed
case, and sliding to and from it by wheels above. It
may be distinctively called a hanging case or press.
It is better suited to the arrangement of aisles and construction
of floors in the British Museum than to most
American libraries, and so far as I know has not been
copied here.</p>

<p>[See illustration in Library Notes,<a id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> and also in Burgoyne.<a id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a>]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"></a>[300]</span></p>

<p>Another double press used at the Museum is called
by Dr. Garnett the pivot press. It is apparently a
second case, kept front to front close to the fixed case
and swung out from it when wanted, by a door-motion
hinged on a perpendicular pivot; overhung, I gather,
at the Museum, but elsewhere running by wheels on
metal semi-circular tracks laid on or in the floor. Such
were early experiments in Trinity College, Dublin,
twenty-five years ago. These might be called folding
bookcases. They have not yet been copied in America.</p>

<p>A third kind of movable bookcase, which may more
properly be called the sliding case, is used in the Patent
Office Library, London. This apparently also swings
from the top. Duff-Brown<a id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> describes it: “These
presses are swung closely side by side, and drawn out,
one at a time, as required.” He does not say drawn
out endwise, however.</p>

<p>This idea is developed in The Librarian<a id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> by James
Lymburn, who suggests “a store-room of any length,
22 feet wide by 35 feet high, in three stories, lighted
from the roof through iron grating floors; with center
passages of 9 feet, and sliding cases 6 feet long, closely
packed in on each side.” He calculates that such a
room 40 feet long would hold 100,000 volumes; its
advantages being close storage and shelter from dust
and sunlight.</p>

<p>See for illustration, Champneys.<a id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a></p>

<p>Jenner, in the Library Chronicle,<a id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> claims for the
sliding case these merits: Cheapness, as compared with
enlarging the building; possibility of gradual installation
as needed; nearness to other shelves in a classification;
absence of obstacle to light(?) or motion.</p>

<p>I have also received from a dealer in Oxford, England,
a small pamphlet hinting at rather than describing, a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301"></a>[301]</span>
room laid out after Lymburn’s idea. The pamphlet
calculates it will save about half the space taken by
stack storage. These cases, and Mr. Lymburn’s, are
evidently double.</p>

<p>See also H. Woodbine in The Library Association
Record.<a id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a></p>

<p><i>Per contra</i>, H. M. Mayhew says in The Library,<a id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a>
“The drawback of the ordinary sliding or hanging or
extension case is the difficulty of moving so great a
weight whenever one book is wanted.”</p>

<p>I cannot figure out much from these English descriptions
about problems of mechanism, repairs, lighting, or
cleaning.</p>

<p>In America, the general idea of sliding cases has been
discussed since Dr. Garnett’s description of the British
Museum device in Library Notes, and since Mr. Gladstone
called attention to it in the Nineteenth Century
of March, 1890.</p>

<p>Mr. Gladstone describes what he calls these “book
cemeteries” thus, as he has seen the “tentative and
initial processes”:—</p>

<p>“The masses represented by filled bookcases are set
one in front of the other, and in order that access may
be had as required, they are set on trams inserted in
the floor (which must be a strong one), and wheeled off
and on as occasion requires.”</p>

<p>The masses which he thinks ought first “be selected
for interment” are Hansard’s Debates, the Gentleman’s
Magazine, and the Annual Register.</p>

<p>So far as I know only two trials of this idea have
been made here; several years ago by Dr. Little at
Bowdoin College, more recently by Mr. Lane at Harvard
University. Both of these are wooden single cases,
side by side, pulled out by the end, and locked or lockable.
Both slide, not hang.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302"></a>[302]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Lane has now a line of twenty-three in a row,
sliding on ball-bearing wheels at the bottom, which in
turn run on rails countersunk in the floor. At the top,
the cases are held erect and guided, but not supported,
by small wheels along the sides of a T-rail. He uses
his cases entirely for rare books in an exhibition room
on the ground floor, and finds them very satisfactory
for the purpose, although he utters a warning that
provision should be made for free access to all the
mechanism, which occasionally needs repair.</p>

<p>Dr. Little submitted a paper describing his cases to
the A. L. Institute at its New York meeting in 1911.
By reference to a photographic view accompanying
I see that he has a double-decker,—two stories of five
single wooden cases each; each case “about six feet
high and three feet long.” “These cases can be made of
either wood or metal, for either octavos or quartos, supplied
with either fixed or movable shelves.” [At Harvard
the middle shelf is fixed as a brace, the others are
movable.] “They must be mounted <i>at the center of
the base</i> on small ball-bearing trucks which run on metal
rails sunk in the floor. Their tops are at the same time
guided and kept securely in place by a slot and a T-iron,
the friction against which is reduced to a minimum by
rollers, placed horizontally. If properly constructed
and placed upon level rails, a slight pull with one hand
will bring one forth. The increased storage is estimated
at 100 per cent.... We also have the Patent
Office Gazette on six wooden sliding cases like these, on
either side of the door of the room in which they are
stored.... This method of storage is especially economical
in case a depository library desires to keep its
sheep-bound set of Congressional Documents as a unit,
arranged by their serial number.... The cost of
these cases and their installation varies greatly with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303"></a>[303]</span>
the material, finish and location. My first cost less than
$15 each, my last about twice that amount.”</p>

<p>I suppose Dr. Little means this for the cost of each
separate bookcase, fully equipped and mounted. Mr.
Lane’s figures I have not been able to put my hands
on.</p>

<p>So far for the statement of facts. I must confess
to having approached the subject with some prejudice
against the mechanism of these cases, founded on an
experience of sliding doors in dwelling houses, which
slide or not, as they feel like it, and whose machinery
is most difficult to get at and repair. But machinery
can be got under control by mechanics. I yield my
prejudices in view of the evident advantages of this
system, and am prepared to make definite suggestions
as to its use in future repairs or building in this country.</p>

<p>In alterations of those architectural extravagances
which have wasted so much perpendicular capacity in
high rooms and corridors, I see a way to use the style
of cases experimented on by Dr. Little and Mr. Lane,
rather than any of the English styles. Either as a
single story along a wall anywhere, or in the double
story style, swung out anywhere on the vacant floor
of any room or any unnecessarily wide corridor, there
will be relief in the storage of any books not required
for open access or frequent reference;—as Dr. Little
says, “for compact storage of less used books.”</p>

<p>In planning new buildings I hardly think it would
be necessary to set up such cases at first, except perhaps
in the case of rare books as at Harvard, where locked
cases and protection from sunlight were wanted, with
infrequent access; or in equipping rooms for rapidly
growing sets, such as Congressional or State Documents,
Patent Office Reports, sets of periodicals or publications
of societies, or any similar sets whose titles and volume
numbers can be labelled on the ends of the cases; or for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304"></a>[304]</span>
“dead” books. The Oxford pamphlet sketches a room
somewhat after the “Poole plan,” equipped with tables
and chairs toward the windows and a row of sliding
cases along the blind wall opposite the window light.
This seems to me good for many departments.</p>

<p>But except in rooms evidently adapted to such treatment,
I would not install sliding shelves anywhere, but
would most certainly leave space, in a perfectly dry
basement if nowhere else, for possible future installation
whenever need may arise.</p>

<p>One reason for this postponement is this: that several
details must be studied, experimented on, and
perfected before fully equipped rooms of this kind can
be considered as tried out and permanently satisfactory.
Lymburn’s scheme seems good, but the plans presented
by Champneys and the dealers do not work out well on
examination as regards space, light or handling. I suggest
as problems to be investigated,—</p>

<ul>
<li>Smooth and sure working of the mechanism.</li>
<li>Easy access to top and rear for repairs.</li>
<li>Access for cleaning and ventilation.</li>
<li>Incidence of weight (this is not even on floors as in a stack; but is moving, as on bridges).</li>
<li>Lighting (most important) on each face of each case.</li>
<li>Floors sure to remain true.</li>
<li>Width of center aisles for all emergencies.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="subhead-156">PART III<br />
<span class="smaller">READERS’ ROOMS</span></h3>

<h4 id="subhead-157">Reading Generally</h4>

<p>F. B. Perkins<a id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> divides reading into three classes:
Entertainment, Acquisition of knowledge, Authorship.
This epitomizes our American division of reading rooms.</p>

<p>What I shall call the light-reading room will provide
for all who drop in at a library to pass a quiet, restful,
recreative half hour, a very large proportion of readers.
They are attracted by the lighter magazines, the illustrated
weeklies and monthlies, and books into which
they can dip pleasantly for a few moments. This is
generally known as the periodical room.</p>

<p>The serious reading room, usually called <i>the</i> reading
room, is intended for such readers as get books from
the shelves to study or read earnestly and long, or are
preparing themes, papers, newspaper articles—even
(when there is slender provision of separate study rooms)
where they are writing books.</p>

<p>I would add a fourth use of a library—perhaps the
commonest—as it helps all other classes, that is, what
we call reference use. (In England where the reference
library and its reading room seem to cover all reading
of books in the library as distinguished from magazines
and newspapers, this is called quick or ready
reference.) A separate reference room or separate
corner of the reading room near the door holds all the
books to which visitors look for scraps of information,
but never read consecutively.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306"></a>[306]</span></p>

<h4 id="subhead-158">Serious Reading Room</h4>

<p>By this phrase I mean the room for serious readers
who want quiet, but do not need separate rooms. The
English seem to call this the reference room, a name
I apply only to their “quick” or “ready reference”
room. Their “reading room” I call in this work periodical
room, in which books for light or “half hour” reading
in the library may be shelved.</p>

<p>This main or general reading room is usually on the
ground floor in smaller libraries, but may be relegated to
the second or the top, or indeed to any other convenient
floor, accessible by elevators and in good communication
with the stack.</p>

<p>In libraries where there is space for it on the ground
floor, it can be supervised and served from the central
delivery desk, but when elsewhere, it must have a separate
desk and service.</p>

<p>In the largest libraries it often occupies a central position
and a circular form. With a lofty open dome above,
it is an impressive feature, but wastes space which might
be utilized otherwise, and it is said to be more or less
drafty and hard to heat evenly.</p>

<p>Position at the top as at the New York Public
Library, has great advantage in light without waste of
space, or superfluous loftiness. If over the stack
(though the supporting walls have then to be stronger
than usual) it has the advantage of short and straight
lines to the books, and is said to lend itself to enlargement
for readers and books <i>pari passu</i>. Good elevator<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307"></a>[307]</span>
service is a requisite in this form. “I incline more and
more to the reading room on top of the building, especially
in a large city.”—(<i>Dewey.</i><a id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a>) So Andrews, at the
same Conference. He also said, “I believe in the single
reading room [as compared with the Newberry or Poole’s
plan] in a public library as a saving in trained assistants,
and because it is impossible to classify readers in rooms
as you do books.”</p>

<p>“Plain outlines are best. Recesses, alcoves, bay windows
and nooks are difficult of supervision and spoil
the public character of a library.”—<i>O. Bluemner.</i><a id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a></p>

<p>The main requisites of a reading room are quiet,
privacy, light, good air and space.</p>

<p><b>Quiet.</b> This means not only regulations against conversation,
but various physical conditions. For instance,
absence of stir or motion; exclusion of such
magazines as are merely looked over with fluttering of
leaves; exclusion from the shelves (if there must be
shelves around the walls) of books frequently wanted
by readers and attendants; (reference books, class books,
new books and others inviting frequent examination,
should be put on the side or in a corner near the entrance,
concentrating stir there;) noiseless floors; echoless walls
and ceilings; exclusion of outside noises; no stairs directly
into or out of the room; no passage through to
other rooms.</p>

<p><b>Privacy.</b> This requirement can be met by the
proper provision and arrangement of the furniture,
which will be further treated under the head of Tables.
The former method was to use almost exclusively large
open tables, seating ten or more, or tables with lengthwise
and crosswise partitions, setting aside bins or stalls
like voting booths to shut out distracting sights. The
large plain tables are not now in favor, the tendency being<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308"></a>[308]</span>
toward tables for six, four, two, or even one. See
floor plans and interiors of libraries in Koch and elsewhere.</p>

<p><b>Light.</b> Light falling from the left, shaded from the
eyes, focussed on the table in front of the reader on the
book he is reading there, or the paper on which he is
writing, is desirable. If the room is lofty, windows high
in the walls, carefully shaded from glare, are out of
range of reader’s eyes. If lower, as most rooms are, the
table seats should be so disposed if possible as to give
each reader light from the left.</p>

<p>The question of artificial light is discussed elsewhere.
The best of high lamps for diffused light, of side lights
and of hanging lamps to light readers, is a special study
for the architect. As readers have varied eyesight,
individual table lights, adjustable and severally operated
are best on the whole, but the wiring of each table fixes
its location so that it cannot be moved in cleaning or
re-spacing. Bulbs hanging about eight feet from the
floor are much used.</p>

<p><b>Good Air.</b> This is as important as it often is unsatisfactory.
Bad air interferes more than anything else
with clearness and concentration of thought. Mr.
Ranck of Grand Rapids is now chairman of an A. L. A.
Committee on this subject. He writes me: “Personally,
the more I have looked into it, the more I am convinced
that the physiological side is most difficult, not
the mere keeping down the amount of carbon dioxide.
I am inclined to think it will be necessary to make a
number of experimental tests to determine these points.”
The report of this committee will be interesting.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the best thing to do is to get a report from
recent buildings as to their methods, and the success of
each. Evidently the problem varies with the size and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309"></a>[309]</span>
situation of the room and the method of heating,
including heat from artificial light.</p>

<p>If perfect ventilation could be installed, crowded
tables would not be quite so bad.</p>

<p><b>Space.</b> H. T. Hare, an architect, in a recent number
of the <i>Library Association Record</i>,<a id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> writes: “Almost all
our public libraries are too closely packed for comfort,
health and movement. A fifty per cent increase in floor
space would not be at all extravagant.”</p>

<p>If there is money to spare, this might be desirable,
but unfortunately few libraries, large or small, have
funds enough to allow luxuries. The spacing of seats
must be as close as health and convenience will permit.
It is generally agreed that for serious reading, which
may require room to spread books open and to lay
manuscripts beside them, 25 square feet are ample,
20 square feet sufficient, 16 square feet rather a crowded
minimum, to include chair, table and passage-ways.</p>

<p>As to size, Duff-Brown<a id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> suggests finding the <i>daily</i> average
of readers and plan for one quarter of this daily
attendance at any one time during the day, as sufficient
space to allow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310"></a>[310]</span></p>

<h4 id="subhead-159">Reference Room</h4>

<p>As already said this is a very useful room, or section
of a room; indeed it might even be put in an anteroom
or vestibule, to include such books as will be used
for quick consultation, but never for reading. It
should be for the openest and speediest access. As
Spofford specifies,<a id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> “It would include encyclopædias,
dictionaries, glossaries, etc.,” or according to Fletcher,<a id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a>
“general and special encyclopædias (such as music, fine
arts, mechanics, geography, classical, Biblical, biographical,
etc.)” Dr. E. C. Richardson<a id="FNanchor_317" href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> lays down that
“at least a small selection of the best reference books
should be accessible to the public.”</p>

<p>“Place as little hindrance as may be to the busy man
who runs in to glance at the dictionary, directory, or
time-table.”—<i>Bostwick.</i><a id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a></p>

<p>This room need not be as large as either of the other
reading rooms, but it should be most accessible, near
the front door, near the desk, near the catalog. It
should have wall shelving for large and small books,
drawn under specifications by the librarian, for just
what volumes he wants to display there. Revolving
bookcases are convenient here. This is especially the
place for the old-fashioned ledge, and for a few narrow
tables like those used in front of a catalog case, with
small, light chairs or stools; just as little furniture as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311"></a>[311]</span>
would be needed for taking down a volume at a time
to glance at, or to take brief notes from. How many it
should accommodate at once depends on the library
and its use. It will be wanted, in brief visits, by very
many of the visitors, down even to the children of the
higher grades of the schools.</p>

<p>Although one of the most important departments of
large or small libraries, it is not the place for high walls
or architectural ornament. It should have especially
good light at all points day and evening, for the type
of many reference books is so small as to try the eyesight
at its best.</p>

<p>If there is not space in the building for a separate
room, put it, if possible, in the same room with open-access
shelves, or the magazines, or in a corridor, where
there is already some confusion; for the use of reference
books is a distraction to serious reading anywhere near.
If they must be put in the reading room, give the reference
books a stretch of shelving or a corner near the entrance
and desk, so that their consultation will leave serious
readers afar off and undisturbed.</p>

<p>Might not a good arrangement of a reference room
be on the window side of the delivery or open-access
room, with broad alcoves opposite the light, and with
a good ledge under the windows; or just with floor
cases perpendicular to the windows, spaced wide like
open-access shelves, but having old-fashioned ledges to
help consultation of reference books? Here is opportunity
for ingenious planning.</p>

<p><b>Standard Library.</b> Mr. Foster’s plan of a Standard
Library room at Providence has something to commend
it from an educational or didactic point of view, but
it would hardly be much missed by the public. In new<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312"></a>[312]</span>
buildings where all available space is in demand for
more imperative needs, I doubt if I should include such
a room, unless already adopted as part of the policy of
the library. If it is, however, to be included it should
have an architectural dignity—not necessarily splendid—to
conform to its purpose. Why might not this be
combined with the trustees’ room? The bindings of
the books would adorn the walls, and make the room a
worthy meeting place of the board at evening, without
interfering with what I imagine is not an eager or
crowded use by the public during the day.</p>

<p>Or, if its object be not quiet reading, but to bring the
books prominently to notice, to exhibit them, why not
treat it as an open access or club room, open to conversation?
Would not this further its primary object,
attract visitors, and promote taking these volumes
home or into quiet reading rooms to read?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313"></a>[313]</span></p>

<h4 id="subhead-160">Light-Reading Rooms</h4>

<p id="subhead-161"><b>Half-hour reading.</b><a id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> This is generally called Magazine
or Periodical room in our libraries, but I should include
in it some provision for casual reading of books also.
In 1903 I suggested at an Atlantic City Conference,
shelving in such rooms for a class of books every library
owns, but usually scatters under various classifications,
although their common purpose is for episodical or
temporary entertainment, such as is known as “half-hour
reading.” On this shelving I advocated placing
a good selection of the best short stories, readable
essays, anthologies, brief poems, humor, and so on, to
be read in the room, just as magazines are used, for such
pastime as the reader’s time will afford.</p>

<p>“Three-quarters of the readers are destitute of literary
culture, but need recreation and pastime.”—<i>Winsor.</i><a id="FNanchor_320" href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a></p>

<p>My suggestion then evoked interest, but I do not
know that it has been acted on anywhere. I renew it
here as a use for wall shelving in periodical rooms for
new buildings, and in concentrating there all recreative
reading. In this light-reading room a certain amount
of movement and noise must be expected, which will
not much annoy the readers there. The coming and
going of visitors whose stay must be brief, the handling
of magazines or books, the turning of pages, the rustling
of newspapers, perhaps the murmurs of children over
illustrations, are to be expected. Here such wall shelving
as has been suggested would not be out of place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314"></a>[314]</span></p>

<p id="subhead-162"><b>Periodicals.</b> Here are kept such few local and
metropolitan newspapers as are taken by the average
library. Magazines and weeklies either lie freely on
large flat tables or are kept for open access in wooden
pigeon-holes or pockets against the walls without intervention
of any attendant, or are kept behind a counter
to be issued by a special attendant on call. Where
there are many readers and a large number of serials,
experience has shown that it is better to keep them in
pigeon-holes behind a counter, to be delivered by an
attendant.</p>

<p>“Where not a large number of periodicals is taken,
they are usually placed on tables without a special
attendant.”—<i>Poole.</i><a id="FNanchor_321" href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a></p>

<p>The furniture of the room and its arrangement will
depend on which system is to be used in the library.
This should be settled in advance.</p>

<p>The chairs used here should be strong, but light; rubber-tipped
so as to be noiseless when moved. Except in
looking at illustrated papers, readers may prefer to hold
octavo magazines, or books, in their hands, turning their
chairs back or side to the light, in the easiest posture.
Arm chairs for such use would be appropriate.</p>

<p>It is not supposed to be necessary to allow so much
floor space for each reader in such rooms. Duff-Brown<a id="FNanchor_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a>
considers 12 square feet enough in England, but our
usage in America is 16 square feet, which is better
for elbow room, passage and ventilation.</p>

<p>“In rooms for magazine reading, there should be
more room for chairs than tables.”—<i>Champneys.</i><a id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> This
seems good advice, unless the periodicals are to be laid
loose on the tables.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315"></a>[315]</span></p>

<p>It is often the custom to put reviews and other serious
magazines in the reading room, leaving all the popular
or recreative serials in the room for light reading.</p>

<p>There are frequent articles in English library journals
about arrangement of magazines, but I find nothing
among them which seems to improve on methods
generally understood here. See Duff-Brown.<a id="FNanchor_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a></p>

<p>“A really effective system, of displaying periodicals
is about as difficult to find as a first folio Shakespeare.”—<i>Burgoyne.</i><a id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a></p>

<p>The few newspapers taken are generally mounted on
sticks and hung from racks, though I have seen them
left loose on tables.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316"></a>[316]</span></p>

<h4 id="subhead-163">Newspaper Room</h4>

<p>In English libraries this department seems prominent
in all buildings, large and small. “The English newsroom
is generally the largest and most convenient room
in the building.” In America, a few newspapers are
kept in the light-reading room, but only large public
libraries have separate rooms for newspapers. Where a
considerable collection is kept, a large room will be required,
with single sloping desks against the walls or
double desks on the floor, with or without stools; or
sometimes the papers are hung on the hooks of racks,
and used at tables (with chairs) close by.</p>

<p>The newspaper room may be put in the basement
with a separate entrance, as its use and supervision are
generally separate from other uses of the library.</p>

<p>“Newspaper and magazine rooms should not be too
large; two 30 × 50 are much less noisy than one 50 × 60,
less draughty and easier to ventilate.”—<i>Burgoyne.</i><a id="FNanchor_326" href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a></p>

<p>The opinion expressed by Dr. Poole in the United
States Public Library Report of 1876,<a id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> “It is thought
in some libraries that the expense of newspapers could
be better applied to some other purposes,” seems to be
echoed in recent discussions in England. See The Library
Assistant, Vol. 4.<a id="FNanchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> A moderate view advanced
at one meeting was this: “It is exceedingly doubtful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317"></a>[317]</span>
whether a newsroom is justified in towns with a population
under 45,000.” The matter is well summed up in
the Library Association Record.<a id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> Reading the debates,
and weighing the arguments <i>pro</i> and <i>con</i>, does not lead
one to recommend planners of American libraries to provide
more space for newspapers than it is customary
to allow with us: a rack or two in small and medium
libraries, for local papers and one or two metropolitan
journals, but no separate newspaper rooms except in the
public libraries of large cities. Even there, I imagine
their use is more for reference and information than it
seems to be in England. Champneys<a id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> calls the newspaper
reader “a professional loafer.”</p>

<p>However, “In libraries where the newspaper room is
somewhat inaccessible, there is little annoyance from
the tramp element. Branch library reading rooms in
New York City, put on the third story for lack of sufficient
space below, are almost entirely free from tramps.
People willing to climb to that story really want to
read.”—<i>Bostwick.</i><a id="FNanchor_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a></p>

<p>This fact is worth noting in planning large libraries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318"></a>[318]</span></p>

<h4 id="subhead-164">Children’s Room</h4>

<p>This department, now considered a cardinal necessity
in all libraries great or small, is a development of the
last generation. No special rooms were devoted to
this purpose before 1890. “Today it is tending to be a
practically separate library, with its own books, circulation,
catalogues, statistics and staff.”—(<i>Bostwick.</i><a id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a>)
So great a success has it become, that a library without
special provision for children would now be a curiosity.</p>

<p>In the smallest libraries, with only one room, separate
tables and shelves are set aside for children. As libraries
grow in grade, separate rooms are provided with
special attendants as well. Here the shelving, tables
and chairs are lower, often of two or three suitable sizes.</p>

<p>The idea at the outset was to segregate children so
that their motion and chatter should not annoy adults
who were using the library; now the notion is entirely
educational, to catch and interest young children,
so that they will continue to use the library as they
grow up. There are even separate rooms for smaller
tots, on the kindergarten idea of attracting them with
pictures before they begin to read. This purpose is
furthered by having suitable pictures on the walls.
Rooms are also fitted up for small audiences to whom
stories are read or told.</p>

<p>Although children are only expected for a few hours
every day, they are apt to swarm at those hours. The
room or rooms so used ought to be at the same time homelike,
cozy, attractive, and also well ventilated. The
ground floor is the best place, though the basement has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319"></a>[319]</span>
often to be used, in default of room above, and children
have been sent up one flight of stairs, because they are
better able to climb than adults. The stairs and hand
rails should in this case conform to children’s stature.
If they can be shut off from the reading room by sound-proof
partitions, quiet is preserved for the readers.
Children are apt to be restless and murmurous if not
noisy. “Children do not mind noise and crowding;
adults do.” In large buildings separate entrances are
provided for children.</p>

<p>Special reference rooms are even provided in some
libraries, and in the largest buildings teachers’ rooms
adjoin, so as to bring all school influences into the same
suite and system.</p>

<p>Bostwick<a id="FNanchor_333" href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> advises (why?) that shelving should be
confined to the walls if possible.</p>

<p>In planning, the librarian should determine the scheme
he will adopt for treating this problem, and a room or
portion of a room or a suite of rooms should be assigned
and fitted after the latest and most approved manner.</p>

<p>Discussion is still active, and new methods are developed
yearly with constantly improving conveniences.</p>

<p>In England this movement appears to be viewed
with some distrust. Duff-Brown<a id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> speaks of “the epidemic
raging in the United States.” But he devotes
four paragraphs to it, and Champneys<a id="FNanchor_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> three pages.
The latter, quoting Clay’s School Buildings, gives an
interesting formula of heights of seats and tables for
children of different ages, though he thinks it difficult
to get the small children to use low tables and the reverse.
He also specifies the need of low hand rails for
children on stairs; even two rails, one for adults, one for
children.</p>

<p>See Marvin, pp. 12, 17, 18; Dana, Lib. Pr., 167; Bostwick,
78, 85; L. J. 1897, p. 181; Conf. 19, 28; 10 P. L. 346.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320"></a>[320]</span></p>

<h4 id="subhead-165">Women’s Rooms</h4>

<p>The separation of boys and girls, usually by a low
hand rail, is favored in children’s rooms, by obvious
parallelism with school customs, but the separation of
men and women into different rooms has never been
common in America, although separate tables are sometimes
assigned to “the use of ladies.” But no “woman’s
room” is a necessity to consider in planning. In England
it has been different. Duff-Brown<a id="FNanchor_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> reports eighty
women’s rooms among over four hundred public libraries
there, but he pronounces them unnecessary. Champneys<a id="FNanchor_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a>
also thinks them “an indifferent success.” “Experience
has proved that a separate room for women is
unnecessary.”—(<i>Burgoyne.</i><a id="FNanchor_338" href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a>) If that is the verdict
where they have been extensively tried, there seems to
be no good precedent for wasting space on them in
American libraries.</p>

<p>In various discussions of this subject, it has been
stated that women sometimes use tables set aside for
them, but not special rooms, and that such rooms require
closer supervision, because the few who use them are
more apt to mutilate or deface books and periodicals
than any other class of readers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321"></a>[321]</span></p>

<h4 id="subhead-166">The Blind</h4>

<p>See Bostwick’s chapter on “Libraries for the Blind.”<a id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a></p>

<p>“Books for the blind are handled by a public library
in much the same way as those for the seeing. It is
common to have a separate department or suite of
rooms, but this is not necessary.... Owing to the
size of the books, shelving for them is of unusual depth....
Free access to the shelves is as valuable to a blind
reader as to one who has the use of his eyes.”</p>

<p>“The question of space will arise in many places. No
space could, however, be devoted to a more humane
and valuable purpose than the storage of books for the
blind, and every encouragement and support should be
given to the movement.”—<i>Duff-Brown.</i><a id="FNanchor_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a></p>

<p>Because of the space required, very careful consideration
should be given by the building committee as to
how much space the conditions of their community will
allow them to give to such special wants. If they
decide to have rooms for the blind, these ought to be,
if possible, near an entrance from the street level. In
regard to dimensions, shelving, etc., the librarian would
best inquire of some library of the same grade and class.
Experience is the best teacher, and the local treatment
of this subject must be defined and specially planned for.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322"></a>[322]</span></p>

<h4 id="subhead-167">Special Rooms</h4>

<p>Small libraries have no space for differentiation. One
room, or a few rooms, must be divided by rails, low
bookcases, or glass partitions, into the functions they
can manage to separate. But as a library enlarges, and
grows to other stories, it finds many advantages in segregating
different classes of books and readers, thus
approaching Dr. Poole’s plan of separate reading rooms,
or the department plan in universities. Even before
any such activities have grown enough to occupy a full
room, any space in a new plan which can be spared may
well be marked “unassigned.”</p>

<p>Some of these rooms are used in all public libraries
of all sizes except the smallest; some of them are desirable
in many other classes of libraries.</p>

<p>These rooms, in about the order of need, as libraries
grow, are,—</p>

<ul>
<li>(1) Local Literature,</li>
<li>(2) Study,</li>
<li>(3) Classes,</li>
<li>(4) Patents, Science, Useful Arts,</li>
<li>(5) Public Documents,</li>
<li>(6) Art: Prints,</li>
<li>(7) Music,</li>
<li>(8) Maps,</li>
<li>(9) Education,</li>
<li>(10) Lectures,</li>
<li>(11) Exhibitions,</li>
<li>(12) Pamphlets,</li>
<li>(13) Bound Serials,</li>
<li>(14) Special Collections,</li>
<li>(15) Information,</li>
<li>(16) Conversation,</li>
<li>(17) Unassigned.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323"></a>[323]</span></p>

<p>These rooms, except Information, do not demand
ground-floor space, but can be assigned to upper floors.
In a large library, they will be accessible by elevators
anywhere; in a two-story library, or even in one of three
stories with easy flights of stairs, the fewer readers who
want to use them may be asked to climb rather than
the larger throngs of general readers or borrowers of
books.</p>

<p id="subhead-168"><b>Local Literature.</b> I take up this first, because even
a very small library may begin a collection, if only part
of a shelf can be given to it. “In a small place,” says
Bostwick,<a id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> “the library may go as far in such directions
as its resources warrant, and even without financial
ability, it may stimulate sufficient interest to secure
volunteer helpers.” If you have or can get to look at
Duff-Brown,<a id="FNanchor_342" href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> see his specification of the books, etc., a
library may include in a “local collection.” Everything
local in the way of printed matter, is his summary.
See a series of articles in The Library Asso. Rec., Vol. 7,
1905, pp. 1 to 30, and Vol. 13, p. 268. This is an English
example well worth following.</p>

<p>A local collection may include, besides books and
pamphlets, maps, prints, even pictures, for which
hanging space will be needed on the walls. Indeed, if a
local antiquarian society can be drawn in as assistant
handlers and curators, such a collection may assume a
museum phase, and may need low bookcases for books,
with ledges above for models and busts, cupboards for
pamphlets and small objects, even glass cases for relics.
It should have floor space for visitors before all these
cases, and a large table and chairs for committee meetings.
It is one of the rooms which might be shared by
the trustees where accommodations are restricted.
There is ample opportunity for special planning in such<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324"></a>[324]</span>
a room, in accordance with the policies of the administration
of the library.</p>

<p id="subhead-169"><b>Study Rooms.</b> Here again the smallest libraries
cannot spare special facilities. All users must share the
limited space available. But when they get beyond the
one-room or one-floor stage, some corners or intervals
between other departments, or ends of corridors, or
mezzanine rooms, might be found for private rooms, to
be used for individuals, either alone or with one scribe
or typewriter. Even in small towns, there are cultivated
citizens, or professional people, or teachers, or
reporters, even authors, who wish to use books, and
prepare manuscripts alone, and can safely be trusted
to do so without supervision. How great a service
such rooms might do in any American community, I
do not think is generally recognized.</p>

<p>“It is the library alone that can furnish inventors,
investigators, and students of all kinds the opportunity
to forestall wasteful effort.”—<i>Bostwick.</i><a id="FNanchor_343" href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a></p>

<p>For individuals, such rooms can be small, and low,
of almost any form, simply furnished with one small
table and two chairs, with shelves at one side or end for
a few books, and one window, not necessarily large, but
giving good light on the table.</p>

<p>“A large room with stalls, or a series of small rooms
with shelves, for students making protracted investigations
and needing to keep books several days.”—<i>Winsor.</i><a id="FNanchor_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a></p>

<p>Duff-Brown, however, thinks that students’ rooms
only establish another “privileged class,” and make
further demands upon the staff for service and oversight.</p>

<p id="subhead-170"><b>Rooms for Classes.</b> In close connection with the
last idea (indeed rooms might be interchanged for use<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325"></a>[325]</span>
either several and collective), are the many classes,
clubs, associations, etc., in the community so closely
connected with the use of books that the library ought
to offer them whatever hospitality its space can afford.</p>

<p>“The modern public library is the helpful friend of
scientific, art, and historical societies, of the educational
labor organizations, of city improvement organizations, of
teachers’ clubs, parents’ societies, and women’s clubs. At
the library should be rooms suitable for their gatherings.”</p>

<p>“One of the most important things in a library of any
size is a room where a class can be met by their teacher,
and not interfere with the regular work of the library.”—<i>C. A. Cutter.</i><a id="FNanchor_345" href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a></p>

<p>“Study clubs, reading circles, extension teaching, and
other allied agents.”—<i>Dewey.</i></p>

<p>See liberal and well-lighted group of “seminar rooms”
in the Wisconsin State Historical Society plans.—<i>Adams.</i><a id="FNanchor_346" href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a></p>

<p>In a paper by Arthur E. Bostwick (which I happened
upon in an English periodical<a id="FNanchor_347" href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a>), there is this interesting
account of the various uses of rooms in branch libraries
at St. Louis: “Each has an assembly room <i>and one or
more club rooms</i>, which are loaned free to any organizations
desiring to use them for intellectual advancement,
or for legitimate forms of recreation, such as women’s
clubs, chess clubs, groups of working men, socialists,
classes in literature and philosophy, self-culture, and
reading circles, art or handicraft societies, athletic clubs,
dramatic clubs, military organizations, ecclesiastical
bodies, the Boy Scouts, high school alumni, English
classes for immigrants, D. A. R., etc.” I imagine that
most trustees would draw the line far short of the “etc.,”
but the list indicates to what length libraries are going
on social and sociological lines, for which provision
must be made in building.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326"></a>[326]</span></p>

<p>Rooms for this purpose may be plainly painted and
plainly furnished, but should be adequately high, especially
well ventilated and made cheerful by color and
light. How to define their sizes would be a matter for
the local librarian to guess at, with his line of activities
well mapped out. Where so much work beyond mere
reading is to be done, there should be at least one sizable
lecture room (the basement would do), one or more
large rooms divisible by screens into several smaller
rooms, and as many smaller rooms with sound-proof
provisions as space would allow.</p>

<p id="subhead-171"><b>Patents, Science, Useful Arts.</b> In industrial communities
a room or suite of rooms for the literature of
science and the useful arts, including sets of English
and American patent specifications, will be found useful.
Winsor<a id="FNanchor_348" href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> emphasized the necessity of providing for rapid
growth in this department, at that time “150 large volumes
a year.”</p>

<p>A small library may properly shelve such scientific
books as would especially benefit its working constituency,
but could not think of patent reports. This is a
luxury for the large libraries only, with present and
prospective space to spare. Floor space is necessary
for readers, with tables large and plentiful enough for
many large volumes and plates outspread. Shelf room
is needed around the walls or in alcoves, on the ground
floor for the octavos, above for the larger books. Where
the stories of the building have been already made
lofty (it would not be necessary to have them lofty for
this room alone), a favorite form has recurred to the
first American “typical plan,” to have around the
walls tiers of alcoves and galleries combined, about
the only place this discredited arrangement survives.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_327"></a>[327]</span></p>

<p>Where the height of stories does not invite this form,
such rooms can well take a frequent law library phase,
with tables near front windows and combinations of
wall shelving and wall cases opposite the windows,
narrow alcoves as it were, for book storage, but not for
readers.</p>

<p>Here seems an excellent opportunity to install some
form of the new sliding cases, say a row of such cases
along an inner blind wall, with tables and chairs toward
the windows.</p>

<p id="subhead-172"><b>Public Documents.</b> “Pub. Docs.” are a burden on
all libraries. They are the first gift to small village
libraries, the accumulating gifts to growing libraries, the
incubus on large libraries, and yet all feel obliged to
keep at least part of them. Some of the national and
state publications are very valuable, when distributed
throughout the classes to which they belong; but of the
large mass of records which ought to be preserved somewhere,
what shall be retained, and where shall it be
kept?</p>

<p>“Do not waste time, in the early days of the library,
in securing public documents, save a few of purely
local value. Take them if offered and store them.”—<i>Dana.</i><a id="FNanchor_349" href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a></p>

<p>See the sensible suggestions of Bostwick:<a id="FNanchor_350" href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> “Government
documents are a bugbear to many libraries.... We
have some getting more than they want, others
that have to buy them. The library of moderate size,
not a repository, is inclined to disregard all government
publications, which is a pity. The large library will
shelve everything.”</p>

<p>A serious problem in planning is where to stow this
superfluity without interfering with essentials.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328"></a>[328]</span></p>

<p>In an old house closets, upper stories and dry cellars
can be fitted with fixed wooden shelving (for the sets are
of uniform or similar sizes), some for octavos, some for
quartos. New buildings may have a room or rooms
assigned almost anywhere out of the way, even in the
center of cellar or attic, with only artificial light. If the
original or duplicates of the most important volumes are
shelved under subjects elsewhere, the use of pub. docs.
will be so infrequent that their location is a subordinate
question.</p>

<p>How much space to assign is a question that depends
on the circumstances and policy of the library; for
instance, whether it is keeping United States, state and
foreign government issues; or only one or part of one.
In a small library a closet or an obscure corner will do.
In a larger library, a dry part of the basement or cellar
is enough. In a very large library, wherever space
can be best spared.</p>

<p>Here again sliding cases may come into play.</p>

<p>How much space this literature may occupy is indicated
in the L. C. Report of 1901,<a id="FNanchor_351" href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> which states that
there were 87,654 volumes under this head in the Library
of Congress at that date, besides 12,442 state “Session
laws.”</p>

<p id="subhead-173"><b>Duplicates.</b> A room for laying aside duplicates is
needed in all libraries large enough to have them. It
needs as much rough wooden wall or floor shelving as
the number or prospective number of duplicates demands,
and can be put in cellar, basement, attic, or in
any place not needed by the more active departments.
It is one of the rooms that do not absolutely need good
natural light, because it is not to be used by readers
or the public.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_329"></a>[329]</span></p>

<p>There should, however, be space enough for ready
access to the books by attendants, and light enough
for inspection. If there is to be any attempt made at
systematic and continued exchange of duplicates with
other libraries, this space and light will be more needed
than if storage only is required.</p>

<p>As handling, access and inspection may be required
at any moment, this class of books seems hardly adapted
to sliding-case shelving.</p>

<p id="subhead-174"><b>Art.</b> Small libraries cannot spare a separate room for
this literature. But in many buildings in æsthetic
communities of no great size, an “Art Room” is set
aside before other extra departments attain the dignity
of separation. Often a suite of rooms is assigned to
the ornamental arts, Art, Prints and Photographs,
Architecture, etc. Here, if anywhere, some elaboration
in cases, shelving and furniture, in harmony with the
motive, is excusable. The rooms surely should be most
attractive in form and color. The bindings in themselves
of books of these classes are usually decorative.</p>

<p>An unusual proportion of the shelving should be designed
for large quartos and folios, to be laid flat and
handled with care; part of the shelves, at least, with
rollers.</p>

<p>Glazed bookcases preserve valuable books from dust
and grime. Sliding doors leave them accessible. Large
tables or desks or sloping ledges, with specially good
light, are needed.</p>

<p>The location of such rooms should be prominent. No
space can usually be spared on the ground floor, but a
second floor, with simple, dignified, easy stairs, is an
excellent location, and the top floor superb, as it allows
good top light without interfering with wall space for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_330"></a>[330]</span>
shelving and engravings above. Especially is this floor
appropriate, if its center is allotted to an exhibition
room on whose walls or in whose cases public exhibitions
of the library’s artistic prints and portfolios can
be occasionally held.</p>

<p><b>Prints.</b> Bostwick<a id="FNanchor_352" href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> says, “A department of the public
library that is increasing in interest, and that may be
said to be partly art collection, partly repository of
useful information in pictorial form, is the print department.... Such
collections are of value” (to eight
specified classes of readers).</p>

<p>This use should be considered in planning an art room
or suite.</p>

<p>See fine photographic view of the Division of Prints
in L. C. Report 1901,<a id="FNanchor_353" href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> which will suggest ideas of arrangement.</p>

<p><b>Public Photographing.</b> “In connection with such a
suite, in libraries where visitors are allowed to make
copies, a small room fitted for photographing, with an
adjoining dark room, would be a convenience. In the
largest libraries copies might be made for users at their
cost.”—<i>Burgoyne.</i><a id="FNanchor_354" href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a></p>

<p>Bernard R. Green writes me, from the Library of
Congress, “Be sure to emphasize conveniences for
photographing and other processes of copying.”</p>

<p>Dr. Garnett in Essays on Librarianship<a id="FNanchor_355" href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> argues that
every first class library should have a department to
reproduce books and manuscripts by photography,
managed by an expert on permanent salary, with a complete
equipment.</p>

<p>Burgoyne, in The Libr. Asso. Record,<a id="FNanchor_356" href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> wishes for public
use in large libraries “a room say 10 × 15 with north light,
for making photographic copies of prints and plates so that
valuable books need not be taken from the premises.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_331"></a>[331]</span></p>

<p id="subhead-175"><b>Music.</b> Small libraries cannot afford a separate
room for this use. Such provision as is necessary can
be made in the open access rooms or near the desk.
Bostwick remarks<a id="FNanchor_357" href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> that music is more valuable for
circulation than for reference, sheets of music, and
collections, being usually in quarto or small folio size.
Duff-Brown advises<a id="FNanchor_358" href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> that it be shelved with uprights
only eighteen inches apart, so that volumes or pieces
will support each other.</p>

<p>As the collection assumes an important size, and
includes sets of opera scores and assembled works, it
may be given a separate room, or two small rooms, with
special wall shelving. It has become somewhat usual,
in large libraries, to put a piano here for trying scores,
and phonographs for repeating them. When this is
done, the room or one of the rooms should, of course,
have perfectly sound-proof partitions, to shut off sound
from other departments.</p>

<p>Provision of some kind must be considered for pianola
rolls and phonographic records.</p>

<p>This department may well be assigned to an upper
floor. It should, of course, provide shelving for the
literature of music.</p>

<p id="subhead-176"><b>Maps.</b> Any small library may have atlases, for
which special shelving must be provided. An economical
provision can be made by putting flat shelving under
the table holding the catalog case.</p>

<p>A separate room for this branch of literature, which
includes bound volumes, loose sheets, wall charts,
globes, etc., is set aside only in large libraries. It cannot
be expected on the ground floor, but might be on
the same floor with Art, as it requires similar height,
arrangement, light, and access.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_332"></a>[332]</span></p>

<p>Maps are kept in three forms, as in volumes (either
coming in atlases, or bound up by the library) or in
loose sheets or on rollers. For volumes, sliding, flat,
and upright shelving will provide suitable stowage.
For sheet maps or charts, large, shallow wooden drawers
in dust-proof cases, sometimes with wooden flaps in
front, are usual. Patent metallic map-cases are better,
but more expensive. A high room affords wall space
for such charts as can be read at a distance, and are
frequently used. Wall space from the floor up should
be reserved for hanging maps. Andrews and others
recommend Jenkins’ Map Roller. For using maps in
any form, large tables in the centre of the room (trestle
tables will do, to be brought in when wanted), and sloping
desks or ledges under the windows, may be provided.</p>

<p>As sufficient space for this department is often hard
to spare, a good location for it is at the end of a corridor.
Here doors can be omitted, and the corridor space can
be taken into the room. The corridor wall opposite
windows is a fine place for hanging maps; the floor of
the corridor, for globes and the like.</p>

<p>See C. W. Andrews,<a id="FNanchor_359" href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> Windsor,<a id="FNanchor_360" href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> Bostwick,<a id="FNanchor_361" href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> Duff-Brown,<a id="FNanchor_362" href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a>

See also a fine view of the Library of Congress map
room in their 1901 report.<a id="FNanchor_365" href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> To show how important a
department this may become, and what room it may
occupy, take note that the Library of Congress has 2,600
atlases and 57,000 maps and charts.</p>

<p id="subhead-177"><b>Education.</b> This is an important subject in large
libraries, and may even demand a separate room in
smaller grades where there is much school work done.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_333"></a>[333]</span></p>

<p>A simple room of moderate size and height, simply
furnished, with wall shelving or floor cases for pedagogic
literature will answer all purposes for teachers, committees
and interested citizens.</p>

<p>Its position would best be near the school or children’s
department, using the same entrance.</p>

<p>It might also be used for teachers with classes, for
laying out and sending out books to schools, or for a
school reference department.</p>

<p>Indeed, as all Art rooms may properly be grouped
together and assigned to the same floor, all rooms connected
with children, schools, teachers, or education
should be shared, or grouped together with a common
entrance, corridor, or stairway.</p>

<p id="subhead-178"><b>Lectures.</b> There seems to be a difference of opinion
in this country as to the necessity or even the advisability
of giving up space to assembly rooms or lecture
rooms.</p>

<p>“In a small building an assembly room is a nuisance,”
says Bostwick.<a id="FNanchor_366" href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> See, however, his enumeration quoted
under Rooms for Classes,<a id="FNanchor_367" href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> of the uses to which an
assembly room has been put in a St. Louis branch.</p>

<p>In England, lecture rooms among progressive libraries
are considered essential.<a id="FNanchor_368" href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a></p>

<p>It seems to me that a part of the basement, in all
buildings which have basements, can generally be spared
for a fairly large room to be put to a variety of uses,
which even if not directly germane to the use of books,
are proper work for a neighborhood club, which is what
the modern small or branch library is coming to be.
A fine room can be made under radial bookcases.</p>

<p>It is not necessary, or wise to have a sloping floor
such as is used in colleges or public halls; too much
height would be wasted by the slope. Nor need the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_334"></a>[334]</span>
platform be large or high;—a foot high, enough for
store-room under it, through trap doors, for such extra
camp chairs as are needed for audiences; with enough
light, removable tables, and light chairs for all uses to
which the room might be put; a dead white wall back
of the platform, and such arrangements as would allow
stereopticon exhibitions; effective ventilation for a full
room, even with the low ceilings of a basement, and you
have provision for many needs of a small library. In
larger buildings larger rooms may be provided, but
always such as could be used in various ways, at different
hours of day or night.</p>

<p>Six square feet, Duff-Brown<a id="FNanchor_369" href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> and Champneys<a id="FNanchor_370" href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> consider
enough to allow for every auditor, including seats,
gangways and platforms. Marvin<a id="FNanchor_371" href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a> says the same, but
does not include platform.</p>

<p>For the use of audiences, while the rest of the library
is working, there should be a separate outside door or
wide door into a corridor directly communicating with
the outside.</p>

<p>As such rooms are not so much used for reading, and
are not high in the walls, light fixtures need not be so
numerous or powerful.</p>

<p id="subhead-179"><b>Exhibitions.</b> Where funds are scant, I doubt whether
it is best to provide an art gallery for permanent or occasional
exhibitions of pictures, with the necessary disposition
of lights. But in sizable buildings, a large room
can be spared for exhibitions directly or indirectly connected
with books, and such a room can be so fitted up
as to receive busts, statues and pictures presented to
the library.</p>

<p>The center of the top floor of the main building offers
an excellent position for a large room for exhibition
purposes, with daylight from the roof. If suitable wall<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_335"></a>[335]</span>
material and covers are provided as background for
pictures, with picture mouldings and with glass cases
for the floor, it is ready for showing specimens of printing
or binding, rare books, manuscripts, or prints and
engravings.</p>

<p>As such an apartment would not be used for reading,
it may be a common corridor for many rooms opening
around it, which are devoted partly to exhibition, partly
to consultation; for instance, art, music and maps. Thus
arranged, the top floor would segregate many functions
which elsewhere might interfere with the quiet of
readers; and would provide most agreeable conversation
facilities.</p>

<p id="subhead-180"><b>Pamphlets.</b> In many libraries gifts of pamphlets
are received, which cannot be separately catalogued at
once. It is sometimes necessary to let them accumulate
until time is found to assort them, decide what to keep
and what to give away, what to bind and what to file
in pamphlet boxes. In small libraries they can be kept
temporarily in closets. In large libraries they often
assume such bulk as will fill a room. Their stay in this
form is so temporary that the room assigned can be
remote (in the attic, for instance, of an old house), and
very plain, not even finished, except for such light as
will be needed in sorting and such heating as will keep
workers comfortable.</p>

<p>Trestle tables, kitchen chairs, rough fixed wooden
wall or floor shelving, will answer all purposes, and save
money for use elsewhere. When the pamphlets are
boxed or made ready for binding, they need not return
here, but may find their places elsewhere in the stack or
special rooms.</p>

<p id="subhead-181"><b>Bound Serials.</b> Except a few serials which cover
only special subjects, these are usually kept together,
for general magazines in use are somewhat like encyclopædias.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_336"></a>[336]</span>
They are perhaps more readable, but are
not often used for reading; rather for reference through
Poole and other indexes. In any considerable collection
they occupy so much shelf room that they will soon
fill a large room by themselves, and they are so kept in
many libraries. In the Library of Congress there are
123,805 volumes of bound periodicals, 68,127 of them
“general.”<a id="FNanchor_372" href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> If placed in the stack, the basement is a
good assignment for them, for various reasons. If
they are to have a room elsewhere it can be anywhere
available; with wooden floor cases (movable shelves) and
plain walls and ceiling so colored as to reflect light.
As they are often heavy and awkward to handle, and as
readers may want to give them a first examination on
the spot, tables at one side of the room and carrels in the
windows will facilitate use.</p>

<p>Sets of society publications are often kept in the
same room with these serials.</p>

<p><b>Bound Newspapers.</b> These require different storage.
Small libraries will have to keep what they get,
as they keep atlases and other folios. Growing libraries
which have fireproof vaults will want to keep valuable
local files there. Larger libraries with many newspapers
must settle just how to keep them. It is not wise, even
not possible, to set such heavy folios on end; they must
be kept flat on the shelves. At first, economy may
require using plain wooden shelves of special measurements,
laying two or three folios on their sides on each
shelf. But if there is much use of the papers, handling
them in this way is difficult for readers and injurious
to the folios. As soon as money can be spared, proper
conservation and convenience require metallic roller
shelves, which specialists will furnish. Those in the
Massachusetts State Library have been found very
satisfactory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_337"></a>[337]</span></p>

<p>Champneys<a id="FNanchor_373" href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> advises “very rough and ready storage;
special rooms with open racks; magazines around the
walls, newspapers in the center.”</p>

<p id="subhead-182"><b>Special Collections.</b> “Large libraries are apt to
receive gifts, to be kept apart, either from direction or
policy.”—(<i>Winsor.</i><a id="FNanchor_374" href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a>) “A large library never has enough
rooms for them.”—(<i>Poole.</i><a id="FNanchor_375" href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a>) Fletcher<a id="FNanchor_376" href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a> speaks of the
numerous gifts to libraries to buy books in some special
department, giving a list of eighty-two subjects of such
benefactions, with the names of recipient libraries, summarized
from Lane and Bolton’s Harvard Bibliographical
Contributions. The Library of Congress Report
of 1901<a id="FNanchor_377" href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a> gives a list of over one hundred and fifty subjects
for separate rooms. Duff-Brown<a id="FNanchor_378" href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> mentions many
English special collections.</p>

<p>Where the donations or bequests are generous, it is
customary to set aside separate rooms named for the
donor, to books thus given. As such libraries are not
often for popular reading, but are used mainly by special
students, they may be assigned to upper floors. Gratitude
suggests that they be treated more ornately than
the stack, or the general reading rooms, and in such
suites, indeed, there is opportunity for an artistic architect
to get noble effects without extravagant expenditure.
Wall shelving is appropriate, or even alcoves, for
their idea is like that of private or club libraries. Floor
cases or special stacks of less severe plainness than
must be used elsewhere, are needed as the collections
become so large as to require close packing.</p>

<p>The local librarian can tell how many such rooms are
needed for the collections already set aside, but how
many to anticipate in building is hard for anyone to
say. Rooms or floors may be reserved, and marked<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_338"></a>[338]</span>
“unassigned,” but experience shows that such spare
spaces are usually wanted for some growth before the
new building is completed.</p>

<p id="subhead-183"><b>Information.</b> In small libraries there is some attendant
at the general delivery desk who can answer miscellaneous
questions. In larger libraries, this duty is
often assigned to one of the staff occupying a separate
desk near the delivery or the public catalog, or supervising
the reading room. In large libraries the Providence
example is good, where a counter on one side of
the large delivery hall is set aside for this use, with its
special collection of reference books handy. Only in
very large buildings is a separate room necessary and even
then it will generally be better to use a small room near
the vestibule, or a nook, or niche or counter, wherever
most convenient for the public to inquire and where it
interferes least with other uses.</p>

<p id="subhead-184"><b>Conversation.</b> Strict quiet is so necessary in
reading rooms, and talking has to be discouraged so
much in most of the building, that a large library ought
to have some place when staff or visitors can be allowed
a chance to talk when they must. Corridors are usually
free from restraint, but it is not often possible to find
seats there, or secure privacy. Vestibules and lobbies,
however, are never needed for reading, and even if used
for exhibitions, can allow more or less comfortable seats,
so arranged in window nooks or recesses as to afford
quiet corners for conversation. The crossing of corridors,
or room under a dome (if such an architectural
misfortune happens) can be utilized for this purpose;
indeed, any vacant spaces on the floor plans, such as
abound in many buildings, can be used for exhibition,
decoration, information, conversation, even perhaps for
smoking,—any diversions outside of reading which
readers might like.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_339"></a>[339]</span></p>

<p>Miss Marvin<a id="FNanchor_379" href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a> wants, even in small libraries, “a room
in which conversation may be allowed, for the use of
committees and for adults who meet at the library by
appointment.”</p>

<p>“Conversation rooms,” says Champneys,<a id="FNanchor_380" href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a> “may certainly
be introduced in large libraries, and their presence
has the advantage of being a continual reminder that
conversation is not permitted in the reading rooms.
In small libraries ... the addition of a large room
which can be used for committee meetings, lectures,
exhibitions, and a variety of other purposes, cannot
but be recommended.”</p>

<p>In other words, talk can be allowed in lecture or
exhibition rooms.</p>

<p>Staff talk is well provided for in any library in the
staff work and rest rooms. Subdued talk about books
might be allowed in reference rooms or open access
rooms. This, with freedom to talk in halls and vestibules,
may preclude necessity for a separate conversation
room even in large libraries.</p>

<p id="subhead-185"><b>Unassigned.</b> Notwithstanding this list of special
rooms required, including most of the uses which can be
foreseen, there is always opportunity in a progressive
library, for more space still to be used, either in enlarging
departments, or in establishing new ones. In
planning, the wise way is to include specific assignment
of space or rooms to all existing departments, and such
others as seem to be on the lines of probable development,
but also to get more room still, to be marked
“unassigned.” It will be taken up sooner than anyone
anticipates. Indeed, as has been already said, there
are many instances, where the spare space left “unassigned”
in planning has been claimed even before the
building is finished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_340"></a>[340]</span></p>

<p>Instead of having lofty rooms, it is always best to
divide the height of a library into as many floors as
possible, making none loftier than actual use will
require for light and ventilation. Never allow superfluous
height of rooms or stories for architectural effect,
outside or inside. Only by watching and limiting
waste of space, in breadth, length or height, can you
get the maximum of opportunity out of money you
spend, or be able to get either all the departments you
want or unassigned room additional.</p>

<p>If basement or cellar is not all taken up with your
assignment of departments and rooms, underdrain and
line the foundations carefully, and provide for such
future features as duplicates, public documents, or
rows of sliding cases for close packing of less used
books.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_341"></a>[341]</span></p>

<h3 id="subhead-186">PART IV<br />
<span class="smaller">FURNITURE AND EQUIPMENT</span></h3>

<p>I have mentioned these already under different
headings, where they materially affected the size, shape,
lighting, or situation of rooms. I shall not go into an
enumeration or description of different outfit, because
there are so many specialists, so many tastes, so many
systems in different libraries, that selection of the latest
and best devices offered by dealers accessible to the
librarian is very easy. But a few general remarks on
one or two articles, may properly be included in a
general discussion on planning.</p>

<p>In the first place, never allow the furniture, fixtures or
fittings to be chosen primarily for architectural effect,
but for special use and fitness in every detail. In
material, in shape, in hue, have them harmonize with
the surroundings, for in such harmony lies the most
effective and the least expensive beauty. Here, the
taste of the architect can be of the utmost assistance.
But, if possible, bar out what has been called “architectural”
furniture, even if money can be spared for it.
Heavy show-pieces, hard to move, hard to use, inconvenient,
uncomfortable, wasteful of space, are an
abomination in any library.</p>

<p>As to proportion of expenditure, Duff-Brown<a id="FNanchor_381" href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a> allows
eighteen per cent of total cost for fittings and furniture.
He suggests, however, that fittings which are fixtures
should be counted as part of the permanent structure.
Perhaps this qualification explains the different estimate
of Champneys,<a id="FNanchor_382" href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a> who allows only ten per cent for furniture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_342"></a>[342]</span></p>

<p>Bostwick<a id="FNanchor_383" href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a> also recommends that fixtures be included
in the general contract, and movables (which he specifies)
be bought separately. He makes an excellent suggestion,
that where this is done, a piece of the material to
be matched, in its finished form, be sawed in two, and
one piece handed to each contractor, so that the furniture
and fixtures will match exactly. How important
this is will be realized at many libraries, where the
tint of fittings meant to match, often “swears.”</p>

<p>Miss Ahern, editor of Public Libraries, writes to me, in
answer to an inquiry:—</p>

<p>“I believe in putting technical equipment outside the
lines of library building and architecture. A builder
cannot make it as well as a specialist in library equipment.”</p>

<p>My experience leads me to endorse her advice most
heartily. I would say further, what she probably
modestly refrains from saying, on account of her business
connections, I would get the catalogues of The
Library Bureau, ask and take their advice, and give
them the preference where their prices are as low. I say
this (I have not even an acquaintance with their present
management) because theirs was the first attempt to
serve libraries on this line intelligently, and I have understood
that many years of altruistic experiment, advised
by good librarians, were spent before they even met
their expenses; so that their services merit a reward.</p>

<p>Miss Marvin<a id="FNanchor_384" href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a> gives a “Typical List of Furniture”
for a small building, with prices ruling in her section
at the time she wrote. She fears, however, that she
may have erred toward too great economy, “cheap
furniture being unsightly as well as unprofitable as an
investment.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_343"></a>[343]</span></p>

<p>One matter apparently often forgotten in planning
is the matching or contrasts of color, furniture as well
as woodwork, shelving, and walls and lamp shades.
Not only is the general cheer and comfort of the library
secured by harmonious environment, but eyesight is
deeply concerned in soft and soothing effects. Here
observation and taste may effect wonders in planning
for both “utilitas” and “venustas.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_344"></a>[344]</span></p>

<h4 id="subhead-187">Tables</h4>

<p>These deserve a separate chapter; they are used
everywhere.</p>

<p>“Good, plain, solid,” epitomizes Champneys.<a id="FNanchor_385" href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a></p>

<p>“Use small tables and light chairs instead of the large
heavy tables and ‘artistic’ chairs, conformed to the
style of the building, but awkward in use.”—<i>Fletcher.</i><a id="FNanchor_386" href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a></p>

<p>“The old style of long tables is now thought cumbersome,”
says Bostwick.<a id="FNanchor_387" href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a> This I endorse, though architects
prefer large tables in large rooms, as more in
proportion. He advises small, rectangular or circular
tables for not more than six readers each. I doubt
the circular in libraries where space is scant. They
waste room.</p>

<p>“Should not be too long, or if double not too narrow.”—<i>Duff-Brown.</i><a id="FNanchor_388" href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a></p>

<p>“Tables for four give readers a feeling of privacy.”—<i>Eastman.</i></p>

<p>For this reason I rather incline to slightly sloping
desks for two, like school desks, in reading rooms; all
facing one way; all with a low back and sides, with a
fillet at the front, to keep books and papers from falling;
with extension slides or trough drawers for open
books at each side of each reader. This form, it seems
to me, combines a minimum of space for desk and passages,
with a maximum of convenience and seclusion
for readers. In the hours when the room was not
thronged, there would be a desk to a reader. If the
desks were rightly faced and the windows and lamps
well arranged, no reader need have direct rays of light
in his eyes, nor dazzling reflection from his paper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_345"></a>[345]</span></p>

<p>As regards height of tables and space to a reader, see
Eastman,<a id="FNanchor_389" href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a> Marvin,<a id="FNanchor_390" href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a> Bostwick,<a id="FNanchor_391" href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a> Champneys,<a id="FNanchor_392" href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a> Duff-Brown<a id="FNanchor_393" href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a>
and Carr.<a id="FNanchor_394" href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> They differ slightly, and each librarian
would best experiment and judge for himself.</p>

<p>The British Museum has a kind of voting booth for
each reader, with 4 feet 2 inches width of desk, high
back and side screens for privacy. Cornell has something
similar, but most libraries cannot afford so much
space or such provisions for privacy.</p>

<p>Polished tops for tables (glass tops are sometimes
inset) promote cleanliness, but are apt to give dazzling
reflections of light.</p>

<p>One general caution echoed by many authorities
warns against bottom cross rails between table legs.
The scraping of readers’ feet against them is noisy,
drops mud on the floor, and soon wears down the rails.</p>

<p>Many libraries have umbrella racks at the end of the
tables, and here the owners can certainly have an eye
on them. But if a coat room cannot be provided with
an umbrella stand, cannot such a self-locking rack be
placed in a lobby, as is seen in many restaurants?</p>

<p>Umbrellas are damp and unsightly as neighbors, and
they occupy space readers might use.</p>

<p>“Readers’ tables should invariably have hinged
flaps for writing, and slides to be drawn out to enlarge
book space.</p>

<p>“There should be standing desks also.”—<i>Edwards</i>,
Free Town Libraries.<a id="FNanchor_395" href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a></p>

<p>Perhaps there was a demand by readers for standing
desks in England forty years ago when Edwards wrote,
but few people want to stand now in America while
reading or writing. A fixed standing ledge against any
vacant stretch of wall near directories, dictionaries or
the like, might be a convenience.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_346"></a>[346]</span></p>

<h4 id="subhead-188">Chairs</h4>

<p>Chairs are an important element in comfort. Strong
enough for rough and constant use they must be. Graceful,
or at least not ungainly, they ought to be and in
most libraries they cannot be superfluously large.
Indeed, there are many places where room can be saved
by using stools, even fixed revolving stools. In some
places armchairs (simple, not upholstered) will make
readers more comfortable. For instance, in places where
they can take up a book or magazine while reading and
lean on the arms. Where a table is used to lay the book
on, armchairs are not necessary, and they always need
more room than plain chairs.</p>

<p>For a small library, the simplest kind of strong,
bent-wood chairs suffice. Wood “saddle” seats, or rattan,
are recommended rather than any upholstery, in
larger libraries. To prevent noise, rubber tips to shoe
the legs—the kind that screw in rather than slip on,
are recommended.</p>

<p>Where there is no special coat room, hat racks underneath
and such wire coat racks on the back, as are
often used on theatre seats, are conveniences. Mr.
Foster has these in the Providence Public Library, but
he tells me they are not much used.</p>

<p>Chairs look better if they match each other, the
tables, and the shelving, in material, style and color.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_347"></a>[347]</span></p>

<p>In planning it is wise after you have decided how
many seats you want in each room, to have the architect
sketch a floor plan and draw in shelving, tables
and chairs, allotting to all the space which experience
has taught is required for each reader in each room, as
you intend to run it; and then carefully study the positions
of the furniture and the dimensions of all the
passages, checking results by examination of plans and
visits to libraries which you think are satisfactory, until
you are satisfied that you have reached the maximum
of convenience with a minimum waste of space. A
few hours’ time spent in this apparently trivial matter
may mean much in ease of administration for years to
come.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_348"></a>[348]</span></p>

<h4 id="subhead-189">Delivery Desks</h4>

<p>In the very small library, where every expense must
be watched, all the furniture may have to be of common
shapes and material, such as can be bought at the
nearest furniture store. But as soon as any necessary
luxury can be afforded, build or buy a specially designed
charging and delivery desk, for this is the center and heart
of almost all libraries of any size or any class. Do not
have it built by a local carpenter, but wait until you can
buy it from an experienced cabinet maker, or better,
from a first-class library fittings expert. Study catalogs
and plans to see what comes nearest to your
needs and methods. If you find within your means a
model which entirely suits you, get it. But if using
of that or other makes of desks, or trying your own
methods, or suggestions of other librarians, have led
you to think that some modifications would suit better,
it will not cost much more to have them made in the
style which otherwise pleases you. Indeed, if your
wants are wise, you will find that a dealer may meet
them without extra charge, in the hope that his desk will
thus commend itself to other librarians. Only by this
gradual study put into form by clever librarians, can the
ideal desk be gradually evolved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_349"></a>[349]</span></p>

<p>From the foregoing remarks on points of contact between
library and public it will be seen that many of
these are localized at a single point—the loan desk.
“This point may be regarded as the heart of a public
circulating library.”—<i>Bostwick.</i><a id="FNanchor_396" href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a></p>

<p>“<i>It may happen that the position and size of this desk
may determine in conspicuous particulars the character
of the whole building.</i>”—<i>Idem.</i><a id="FNanchor_397" href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_350"></a>[350]</span></p>

<h4 id="subhead-190">Catalog Cases</h4>

<p>As the card system has been so universally adopted
in America, and worked out to such standards of size
that the most convenient makes, dimensions and sizes
of cases for every grade of library are kept in the market
in all large cities, there is no need of describing them
here. But I would make some suggestions as to how
they may influence planning.</p>

<p>Cases for small libraries may not need a special base,
but can be used on any table, flat desk or ledge. As
the library grows, it needs more cases, and a special
base, such as all makers furnish, may be wanted. As
cards, like books, are more easily used when they can be
seen by the reader without craning or stooping, their
increase is better met by broadening than by piling up,
until wall space fails. In the first form of base used,
it is better to utilize the space under the table, not so
much in the cupboards or open spaces suggested in some
catalogs, as in the upright or flat shelving of the quartos
or folios (such as atlases) not handled so often as to
interfere seriously with use of the cards, the primary purpose
of the cases. This space beneath should certainly
be put to some use wherever space is precious.</p>

<p>One form of catalog case frequently used is double-faced,
set in the partition between the delivery room
and the cataloguer’s room, the drawers pulling both
ways, so that they can be used alternately in either
room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_351"></a>[351]</span></p>

<p>In planning, the first thing is to calculate how many
cards, drawers and cases are needed for the number of
books now in the library, and the annual increase probable,
for at least ten years ahead; better twenty-five
years, if there is wall or floor room which will be vacant
that long. Then comes the very important decision,
vitally affecting the size of the room, perhaps its location,
and the disposition of the windows and lights;
namely, where is the best possible location for the catalog,
considering accessibility, supervision and help? Provision
for growth can be lateral or up and down, or both.
When the drawers get to be more than three or four in a
tier, some provision must be made in front of or beside
them for a ledge or narrow table on which they can be
laid when taken out for inspection. In small libraries
the combined catalog case and atlas rack can be built
so that the table will form a ledge on all sides, for this
use, without other provision.</p>

<p>Good location and light for the public catalog make one
test of the excellence of your plan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_352"></a>[352]</span></p>

<h4 id="subhead-191">Bulletin Boards</h4>

<p>One thing often forgotten in planning is to leave available
wall space where necessary bulletins can be hung and
easily read,—a practical detail not always seen by the
artistic eye. Everyone has seen dome and rotunda
libraries, all columns and no wall.</p>

<p>In planning, however, it is not hard to assign opportunities
in spaces sufficiently well lighted, but of no use
otherwise, for hanging bulletin boards, or so treating
walls as to serve that purpose without special boards.
Lobbies, vestibules, corridors, stairways, spacious delivery
rooms, even railings outside, invite such use.
In England, want-lists are cut out from the daily
papers, mounted on boards, and thus hung outside the
library for inspection by the unemployed.</p>

<p>Places for bulletins should also consider—they do
not always—near-sighted people, and the undersized.
Even in such unprosaic matters, careful planning in
every phase can promote the usefulness of the library.
I remember being shown about a new dome library in the
west, where the librarian turned in distress and asked,
“Do tell me <i>where</i> I can put up my bulletins or lists.”
The only thing I could suggest was that she should get
her architect to design a Parisian kiosk, to be set in the
centre of the useless floor space, under the wasted
heights of the dome; and use the exterior of the kiosk
for bulletins, the interior for the brooms, for which
no closet had been provided.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_353"></a>[353]</span></p>

<p>Miss Marvin<a id="FNanchor_398" href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a> suggests spaces over radiators, shelves,
periodical cases, and book bins. An ordinary screen,
like those used in bar-rooms in any “wide-open”
town, placed in the center of vestibule or hall would
offer two sides for lists and bulletins posted at any
convenient height.</p>

<p>If you have seen how masts going up through the
cabins of river boats or coasters are backed with mirrors,
you have a hint where to put bulletin boards in buildings
on which columns have been inflicted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_354"></a>[354]</span></p>

<h4 id="subhead-192">Other Fittings</h4>

<p>These vary so much with the grades and classes of
libraries, they change so much as inventions are made
from time to time, that I go into no further details here,
but advise librarians who build to examine each item
they want to use, in the light of the last improvements
and the experience of fellow-librarians.</p>

<p>[Burgoyne gives thirty-two pages, illustrated, to English
devices.]</p>

<p>Clocks, thermometers and barometers are especially
recommended by Duff-Brown.<a id="FNanchor_399" href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a> Clocks (noiseless) will
be useful in many rooms, also thermometers, but we
do not watch barometers so much in the United States
as our English cousins do.</p>

<p>A page in your note book devoted to furniture and
gear, when you start out on a reconnoissance among other
libraries, will fix many fleeting impressions which may
come into use later.</p>

<p>And in your trips may sharp eyes and keen common
sense travel with you!</p>

<h3 id="subhead-193">CONCRETE EXAMPLES</h3>

<p>By permission of the librarians of the New York
Public Library and of the Brooklyn Public Library, I
print here extracts from their respective “Terms of
Competition” (already printed in pamphlet form) for
the building just completed, and “General Suggestions
to the Architect” for the building soon to be erected.
The latter, hitherto unpublished, is very full, and is
cross referenced and annotated, therefore likely to prove
especially helpful.</p>

<p>I thus present practical details of the planning of
two large recent American library buildings, in the hope
of throwing a fresh light on the problems I have treated.</p>

<p>It will be noticed that one of these libraries was
built after an architectural competition; the other has
been planned, and will be built, after the method preferred
in this book, selection of the architect at the
outset, without competition.</p>

<p>Librarians, architects and building committees
about to plan a very large library may review their
subject in these summaries; and those engaged in less
extensive plans may select the rooms and combinations
which meet their own needs.</p>

<h3 id="subhead-194">TERMS OF COMPETITION<br />
THE NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY</h3>

<p class="center">Astor, Lenox and Tilden Foundations.</p>

<p><b>Plan of Competition.</b> In May, 1897, the Committee announced
that it proposed to obtain plans by means of two consecutive competitions.
An open competition was to be first held. The Committee
was then to choose from the authors of the twelve most
meritorious sketches certain of the competitors, not more than
six in number; and the persons thus selected, with not more than
six other persons or firms thereafter to be named by the Committee,
were to be invited to take part in a second restricted and
paid competition.</p>

<p><b>Cost and Jury.</b> Each of the competitors will be paid $800, as
the estimated cost to them of the drawings required.</p>

<p>The drawings will be judged by a jury of seven persons consisting
of three practising architects to be selected by the competitors
themselves, three members of the Board of Trustees to be
hereafter named by the Board, and the Director of the New York
Public Library.</p>

<p><b>Experts.</b> The Trustees also reserve the right of appointing consulting
engineers to whom all construction drawings and all drawings
relating to heating, ventilation and electrical apparatus shall
be submitted for approval before they are carried into execution.</p>

<p><b>Plans to File.</b> The architect shall furnish to the Trustees, upon
completion of the building, a full set of drawings exhibiting all
essential particulars of its design and construction, for future reference.</p>

<p><b>Light.</b> All rooms used by the public or for clerical purposes
must have as much daylight as possible. The windows should run
nearly to the ceilings, and in the reading rooms should not come
within five feet of the floor. They should be large and little obstructed
by framework.</p>

<p>The book stacks also should receive as much daylight as possible;
but it is not expected entirely to dispense with the use of artificial
light in the book stacks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_360"></a>[360]</span></p>

<p><b>Heat and Air.</b> The building should be heated by steam applied
in part through hot water, and at least 1,500 cubic feet of fresh air
per person per hour, for all occupied rooms must be warmed,
introduced and properly distributed by mechanical means, and
flues must be provided of such size that a velocity of 6 feet per
second will furnish the above amount.</p>

<p><b>Material.</b> The floors in the main halls, corridors and exhibition
rooms are to be of marble, tile or mosaic; in the Trustees’ and
Director’s Rooms of wood or parquetry; and in the book stacks
of white marble slabs. In the Reading Rooms and Administration
Rooms the floors may be of brick or concrete, as they will be covered
with a thick cork carpet or other noiseless material.</p>

<p>The building must be thoroughly fireproof.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this competition it is to be assumed that the
building will be constructed of masonry, except the book-stacks;
that the so-called skeleton construction of iron will not be employed;
and that the external walls will be faced with Indiana limestone—although,
as hereinafter stated, that material may not be finally
adopted.</p>

<p>The Trustees are advised that the majority of librarians regard
brick as the best material from a practical point of view, and the
competitors are invited to say whether in their judgment it can be
so used as to secure for this building the dignity and monumental
character that is desired.</p>

<p>It is believed that ample opportunity will exist for architectural
and decorative effect; but it is desired that the Reading Rooms at
least should be plainly treated.</p>

<p><b>Tentative Plans.</b> In instituting, in the month of May,
a Preliminary Competition under substantially the same requirements,
the Trustees submitted a set of diagrams showing a tentative
arrangement which was suggested as a possible solution of the
problem, but one for which they entertained no special prepossessions.
The important features of the interior as there shown,
placed the main reading rooms on the third floor, and the book-stacks
immediately below them along the west front of the building.
This plan, which embodied the results of considerable study, has
since then been subjected to the critical examination of the leading
librarians of the country, and has also been carefully reconsidered
by the Committee and their professional advisers in the light of the
abundant illustration afforded by the plans submitted in the Preliminary
Competition.</p>

<p><b>Details.</b> The Lending Department must be distant from the
reading rooms, and must be provided with easy and direct access<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_361"></a>[361]</span>
from the street. The Children’s Room, and the Periodical and
Newspaper Rooms, must be provided with similar easy access and
should probably be on the first floor. The Accession Department
must have direct communication with that portion of the main
stack which is on the same level, and also with the catalogue room—either
directly or by means of a lift. The delivery desk in the public
reading rooms must be central and so situated as to overlook each
of the large public reading rooms. The machinery for bringing books
from the stacks must be as direct and simple as possible.</p>

<p><b>Stacks.</b> The book stacks occupy two stories and the basement
and have the Reading Rooms in a third story above them. This
arrangement gives the Reading Rooms the maximum amount of
light, brings the stacks into easy and direct communication with
them, and allows of the extension of the building towards the west
at some future day, by enlarging both the stacks and the Reading
Rooms simultaneously and proportionately, with a comparatively
small enlargement of the portions of the building devoted to administrative
and other uses.</p>

<p><b>Working-rooms.</b> The administration is concentrated on the
south side of the building. A private entrance for the use of employees
is provided, and also a driveway from the street to admit
of the passage of carts containing books or stores. The boilers,
engines, dynamos and coal vaults are placed outside of the building
and below the level of the 40th Street sidewalk. In the basement
near the driveway are the storerooms, book-bindery, printing room,
and rooms for packing and exchanging books and for issuing them
to branch libraries. Above are receiving rooms for books, accessions
department, cataloguing room, and order and checking department.
Between the administrative part of the building and the
part open to the public, come the rooms for the Director and the
Trustees.</p>

<p>In the basement, near the Forty-second Street entrance, which
will be approximately on a level with the sidewalk, is the delivery
room for the Lending Department, running up into the first story.
It is next to the book stacks, and occupies the lower part of the
northern area or open court, and is lighted from above.</p>

<p><b>Floors.</b> The different floors of the building are to coincide with
the level of the floors of the book stacks. The floors of the book
stacks are to be seven feet and six inches apart, from top to top.
The basement and second stories of the building will accordingly
be fifteen feet in height, from floor to floor, being two stacks high;
and the first story will be twenty-two feet and six inches, or three
stacks in height. The smaller rooms in the first story may have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_362"></a>[362]</span>
rooms over them in a mezzanine. The floor of the basement story
will be a step or two above the 42d Street sidewalk at the entrance.</p>

<p><b>Conditions.</b> The arrangement of rooms in the basement on
the southwest corner, above indicated, permits the packing and
ready distribution of books for the lending branches to be hereafter
established. The central portion of the basement between the
two courts affords a suitable location for the ventilating machinery
of the building. The special reading rooms for students on the
second and third floors, while in easy communication with the
main stack, are removed from the main reading rooms and from
the portion of the building most frequented by the public. The
main reading rooms on the third story are removed from dust and
noise, and enjoy the best form of light from above. <i>It is considered
preferable not to have the rooms very lofty</i>, and the skylights should be
large so as to diffuse the light as much as possible. <i>Domes are
accordingly not desired.</i></p>

<p><b>Stack Light.</b> The arrangement of the stacks affords a reasonable
amount of light, and does not make the stacks wholly dependent
on artificial light, which will be expensive and in other respects
objectionable.</p>

    <td>Main Reading Rooms. In the main public reading
rooms space for at least 800 readers will be required,
with an allowance of 30 sq. ft. per reader, exclusive
of space required for catalogs and reference shelving,
or about 26,800 square feet in all.<br />
<br />
This space should be divided into three rooms,
so arranged that only one need be used at a time,
but that all can readily be served from one delivery
counter, which should be central and close to the
main stacks.<br />
<br />
There should be at least 3,500 feet (linear) of
shelving for free reference books in these rooms
and the Card Catalogue, occupying at least 150
sq. ft., must be provided for near the delivery desk.<br />
<br />
In all the reading rooms and wherever else it is
required, shelving must not be more than seven<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_363"></a>[363]</span>
shelves in height. This gives seven feet of shelving
for each running foot of wall-space. Where there
is not enough wall-space for the amount of shelving
called for, stacks of double shelves, back to back,
may be employed, either projecting from the walls,
or standing free in the room.<br />
<br />
The ceilings of the reading rooms should be kept
as low as is consistent with pleasing proportions.
There should be no waste spaces to be heated and
kept clean.<br />

<h3 id="subhead-195">BROOKLYN PUBLIC LIBRARY CENTRAL BUILDING.<br />
GENERAL SUGGESTIONS TO THE ARCHITECT.</h3>

<p><b>General.</b> These suggestions are intended for the purpose of
assisting the Architect in working out his plans, and in no way to
hamper him. It is possible the Architect may find a different
arrangement of rooms more suitable to the building which he plans,
and while it is desirable that he conform as nearly as possible to the
suggested arrangement it is not necessary to follow it closely.</p>

<p><b>Estimates.</b> In submitting preliminary plans the approximate
cost in the shape of estimate from at least three reputable builders
should be given exclusive of heating, lighting, ventilation, book
stacks and all fixed furniture.</p>

<p><b>Guides.</b> The number of stories should include sub-basement,
basement, and as many stories above the ground as will comport
with the Memorial Arch and surrounding buildings, providing at
the same time adequate capacity for the needs of a Central Library
Building. Your attention is called to the report of the Consulting
Architect, Prof. A. D. F. Hamlin to the Central Building Committee
under date of March 25, 1905; and of the reports of Frederick
Law Olmsted, Jr., made to the Brooklyn League under date of
October, 1905, and of Messrs. Carrere and Hastings to the Mayor
of New York, under date of November, 1905, and <i>the comparative
table of accommodations of various library buildings as prepared by
the Brooklyn Public Library.</i> All these documents should be studied
preliminary to the preparation of plans.</p>

<p><b>Requisites.</b> <i>Architectural effect should be subordinate to utility
and convenience.</i> Consideration should be given to the probabilities
of extensions to the building.</p>

<p>The prime essentials for the library building are light and ventilation.
The building should be lighted on all sides by natural light.
Walls which face open courts should be of light colored material.</p>

<p>The building should be thoroughly fireproof.</p>

<p>The whole building is to be piped and wired for both gas and
electric lighting.</p>

<p>The decoration of the reading rooms should be very simple.</p>

<p>Wall space should not be occupied by heating pipes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_368"></a>[368]</span></p>

<p>All halls and stairways should be ample and well lighted.</p>

<p>The dimensions given may be considerably varied provided they
are not materially reduced. All rooms should be so planned as to
provide wall shelving 3 feet in the clear without loss of space and
without any architectural obstruction.</p>

<h4>ALPHABETICAL ARRANGEMENT OF ROOMS.</h4>

<p>Under each room is given the purpose and best arrangement in
relation to other rooms. The list also includes such headings as
“Furniture,” “Shelving,” etc.</p>

<p><b>Accession Department, see Cataloguing Department.</b></p>

<p><b>Apprentice Class Room.</b> For students who are taking the
training course in the library preparatory to admission to the library
service. Accommodations should be provided for one hundred
students.</p>

<p>Need not be considered in relation to other rooms, and may be
placed on top floor or wherever convenient.</p>

<p>The room might be divided into sections by sliding partitions
so that a part or the whole could be used either for class work or
for entrance and promotion examinations, and should be planned
as a regular school class room containing such necessary appliances
as desks, chairs blackboards, etc.</p>

<p>A sufficient number of lockers should be provided in a dressing-room
near by.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_374"></a>[374]</span></p>

<p>If the room is not divided as mentioned above, a study room
containing a working collection of library literature would make
study possible by members of one class while another class is in
session.</p>

<p><b>Art Book Cases, see Furniture, Art Book Cases.</b></p>

<p><b>Art Book Room.</b> All the large heavy books belonging to
the Art Book Collection will be placed here in cases or on shelves.</p>

<p>There should be accommodation in this room or a nearby stack
for 15,000 volumes.</p>

<p>If an Exhibition Room is not provided the Art Book Room together
with the Photographs, Music and Manuscripts Rooms,
might be connected so that when desired they could be converted
into an Exhibition Room.</p>

<p>If convenient the Art Book Room should be near the Reference
Room.</p>

<p>If located on different floors, the Art Book Room and Photographic
Room should be connected by a large size book lift.</p>

<p><b>Auditor’s Office, see Finance Department.</b></p>

<p><b>Auditorium.</b> It is a question whether in view of the nearness
of the Brooklyn Institute the Library should provide an auditorium.
If so, it should be capable of being turned into an Exhibition Room,
which see.</p>

<p>It is probable that a seating capacity of 400 or 500 would be
sufficient, although it may be thought best to provide for 1,500.</p>

<p>If arranged so as to be used as an Exhibition Room it might be
sub-divided by movable partitions.</p>

<p>It should be provided with lantern and screen.</p>

<p>This hall should be used for literary purposes only.</p>

<p>May be placed on top floor or basement. If the latter, there
should be an outside entrance, and also one from the library proper.</p>

<p><b>Automatic Book Carrier, see Book Carrier.</b></p>

<p><b>Back Numbers of Magazines, see Periodical Reading Room.</b></p>

<p><b>Bell Collection.</b> A collection of 12,000 volumes given by Mr.
James A. H. Bell on the conditions that it should be in a separate
room, and that the books should be for reference purposes only.</p>

<p>Need not connect with any other room.</p>

<p><b>Bells.</b> Connection might be made from some of the rooms,
such as Librarians’, Delivery, Reference, with the janitor and
engineer.</p>

<p>There should be outside door bells so arranged that the current
to same may be turned off or on. Switches to be under lock and
key inside the building.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_375"></a>[375]</span></p>

<p><b>Bicycle Room.</b> A small space is probably all that will be necessary,
and it is a question whether racks outside, or inside the building
on ground floor would not serve the purpose.</p>

<p><b>Bindery.</b> A room should be provided large enough to hold
heavy machinery and to enable the library to have its own binding
done within the building, although it is not at all certain whether
it is not more economical to give the use of the room to some binder
and arrange with him to do the work at so much per volume.</p>

<p>Should go in the basement near the Repair Room.</p>

<p>If all binding is not done by the Library, the Repair Room if
made larger will accommodate the necessary machinery for what is
to be done, and should be so constructed as to bear the weight of
heavy machinery.</p>

<p><b>Blind Department, see Library for the Blind.</b></p>

<p><b>Boiler Room, see Heating Plant.</b></p>

<p><b>Book Carrier.</b> A noiseless device for carrying books from the
Book Stack to the Delivery Desks in the</p>

<ul>
<li>(<i>a</i>) Reference Room.</li>
<li>(<i>b</i>) Delivery Room.</li>
<li>(<i>c</i>) Periodical Reading Room.</li>
<li>(<i>d</i>) Children’s Room.</li>
<li>(<i>e</i>) Delivery Station Room.</li>
<li>(<i>f</i>) Wherever rooms are indicated as near Stack and cannot be so placed the carrier might be used.</li>
</ul>

<p>A very successful carrier made by the Lamson Store Service Co.
is said to be in use by the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh. The
Library of Congress and Boston Public Library also have carriers.</p>

<p><b>Book Order Department.</b> Including the Ordering and Receiving
Departments. Orders for books are sent to this department
and forwarded to the publishers. Books are received from the
same source, unpacked, checked with the bill, etc., before they go
to the Cataloguing Department. A part of the room should be
arranged as a Receiving Room where the cases of books could be
unpacked.</p>

<p>It should be on the ground floor near the Packing Room and
the depository sections of the Stack which contain the stock of unassigned
books (20,000 volumes) and the little used books (30,000
volumes). It should be connected with, but not necessarily adjacent
to, the Cataloguing Department, with which it might be connected
with a freight elevator, so that truck loads of books can be
quickly transferred.</p>

<p>A small office or office space for the Superintendent should be
provided.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_376"></a>[376]</span></p>

<p><b>Bound Files of Newspapers, see Newspaper Reading Room.</b></p>

<p><b>Bound Files of Magazines, see Periodical Reading Room.</b></p>

<p><b>Branches, Superintendent, see Executive offices.</b></p>

<p><b>Building Superintendent’s Room.</b> An office for the Superintendent
of the building should be provided near the entrance on
the ground floor.</p>

<p><b>Building, Size of.</b> Inasmuch as the plot is surrounded by
broad open spaces the building may be brought much nearer the lot
line than would otherwise be desirable. Unnecessary space should
not be given to halls and corridors, although these should be ample.</p>

<p>The size of the Reference and Reading Rooms may be increased
if there is any additional space available.</p>

<p><b>Card Cases, see Furniture—Card Catalog Cases.</b></p>

<p><b>Cataloguing Department (Official).</b> Books for all branches
of the library as well as all departments and the Central Library
are accessioned, and catalogued by this department.</p>

<p>Space should be allowed for at least fifty employees. It may be
on the third floor. It should connect with the Book Order Department
as indicated, and be located near Traveling Libraries and
Interchange Departments.</p>

<p>An office or office space should be provided for the Superintendent
of the department.</p>

<p>The freight elevator might open into a small room or hallway
adjoining the Cataloguing Department instead of opening directly
into the room itself.</p>

<p>The room should, if possible, be so planned that there will be
good light on both sides so that desks may be placed on both sides
of the room.</p>

<p>The space allotted to the department may, if necessary, be
divided into two connecting rooms, one of which would contain
some thirty typewriting machines.</p>

<p>Alcoves formed by book cases might be placed on one side of
the room to separate the desks of the typewriters from each other.</p>

<p>Space must also be allowed for card catalog cases for 2,000,000
volumes. These may be placed back to back and form a sort of
partition through the middle of the room.</p>

<p><b>Cataloguing Department—Library of Congress Depository
Catalog.</b> The cards of the Library of Congress Catalog are
filed in Catalog Cases in this room and the Catalog must be
accessible to the public, and should adjoin the Official Cataloguing
Department. Provision should be made for at least fifty catalog
cases in addition to table, desk, chairs, etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_377"></a>[377]</span></p>

<p><b>Catalog Room (Public).</b> Contains a catalog of all books
in the Library system printed on cards, and arranged similar to those
in the Official Catalog Department. It would be used by the
public and should be near the Reference Room so that the Reference
Librarian could use and supervise it.</p>

<p>If possible it should be accessible for the Delivery Department and
Official Cataloguing Department. Space should be provided for
the same number of cases as in the Official Department. These
cases could be placed against the walls or in rows.</p>

<p><b>Charging Desk, see Furniture—Delivery Desk.</b></p>

<p><b>Check Room, see Coat and Parcel Room—Public.</b></p>

<p><b>Children’s Room.</b> A room for the use of the juvenile borrowers
of the library. All juvenile books will be charged and discharged
in this room. Provision should be made for seating about
two hundred children. The total space allotted for this department
may be divided so that there will be an office for the Superintendent
(who has charge of the work with children), a small room to contain
a selected collection of juvenile books which may be consulted by
teachers, parents, etc., and the reading and delivery room for children.
A portion of the latter might perhaps be partitioned off for
reference use. Plenty of room should be provided for this purpose.</p>

<p>This department should be situated near the Delivery Room of
the library, and if possible, connect directly with the Open Shelf
Room of that department.</p>

<p>The entrance to this room should be similar to that at the Pacific
Branch Library, <i>i.e.</i>, two doors, one for entrance and one for exit,
with a seat for visitors and a railed space where they may stand
without interfering with the children who use the room.</p>

<p>If possible, this room should be easily reached from the street
without stairs or with but few. The entrance, however, should
not be <i>directly</i> into the room.</p>

<p><b>Circulation Department, see Delivery Department.</b></p>

<p><b>Cleaner’s Room.</b> A room near janitor’s with lockers, cupboards,
etc., in which clothes, pails, mops may be kept.</p>

<p><b>Cleaning Device, see Vacuum Cleaning Apparatus.</b></p>

<p><b>Closets.</b> Closets or cupboards for the storage of supplies, etc.,
should be provided in the various departments and work rooms.</p>

<p>Closets for janitor’s brooms, mops, etc., together with a sink
should be located on each floor.</p>

<p><b>Club Rooms, see Study Rooms.</b></p>

<p><b>Coal Bins.</b> Coal bins of 200 tons capacity should be provided.</p>

<p><b>Coat and Parcel Rooms, Public.</b> A room should be provided
where coats, parcels, umbrellas, etc., may be checked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_378"></a>[378]</span></p>

<p>This should be located near the main entrance.</p>

<p>If the auditorium is placed on the top floor a similar room should
be located near it.</p>

<p><b>Committee Room, see Executive Offices.</b></p>

<p><b>Copying Room, see Writing and Copying Room.</b></p>

<p><b>Cork Carpet, see Floor Covering.</b></p>

<p><b>Dark Room, see Photographic Room.</b></p>

<p><b>Delivery Department.</b> From this room the books for home
use would be circulated, and borrowers would be allowed free access
to the shelves.</p>

<p>This room should be easily accessible from the street without
any, or, with but few stairs.</p>

<p>It might connect with the Children’s Room, but it is not necessary
that it connect with the Reference and Reading Rooms.</p>

<p>A collection of possibly 35,000 volumes of the most popular
and standard books should be placed in a room arranged with wall
shelving and stacks something like our branch libraries. This will
not prevent readers from having access to other books under restrictions.</p>

<p>Space should be provided in this room for a Registration Desk
with a possible provision for a Union Register of all borrowers in
the system.</p>

<p><b>Delivery Desks, see Furniture—Delivery Desks.</b></p>

<p><b>Delivery Station Room.</b> The library system may, in the near
future be extended, by the establishment of delivery and deposit
stations throughout the city at which places borrowers may leave
books in the morning and receive others later in the day. The
books so left will be sent to the Central Library to be exchanged
and a room should be provided where this work can be done.</p>

<p>This might be near or part of the Interchange Department,
although this arrangement may not be feasible, as it is desirable
that the Interchange Department should be located near the Cataloguing
Department so that the Catalog may be consulted by it,
and the Delivery Station Room should be on the ground floor to
facilitate the handling of boxes, etc.</p>

<p><b>Depository Stock, see Stack Depository.</b></p>

<p><b>Driveway.</b> A driveway for teams should run through from Flatbush
avenue to Eastern Parkway and into the court, if one is contemplated.
The Packing, Delivery Station and Book Order Department
should open directly upon the driveway. If these are below
the street level, a movable platform should be provided.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_379"></a>[379]</span></p>

<p><b>Dust Flues.</b> Unless the vacuum cleaning apparatus is installed,
dust flues and compressed air with openings on each floor of the Stack
and in the principal rooms in the main building may answer all
purposes.</p>

<p><b>Elevators.</b> Elevators should run from the basement to the top
floor. Two passenger elevators for the public, and one for the
staff should be provided. A freight elevator large enough to hold
two or three trucks (such as used at Montague) at a time will be
needed. This elevator may open into a hallway or room adjoining
the Cataloguing Department if such an arrangement works out
better.</p>

<p>Book lifts should also be generously distributed.</p>

<p>If the auditorium is on the top floor one elevator should be so
situated as to be convenient for those using the auditorium.</p>

<p><b>Employees, see Staff.</b></p>

<p><b>Engineers’ Club.</b> It is a question whether a meeting room
should be provided for the exclusive use of this particular club,
although it seems desirable that a place should be provided where
this and clubs of a similar nature could hold meetings from time to
time.</p>

<p>If a meeting room is provided for the Engineers’ Club it should be
adjacent to the Stack where books of a scientific nature are stored.</p>

<p><b>Engineer’s Rooms.</b> There should be two connecting rooms for
the use of the Chief Engineer; one to be used as an office, possibly
containing closets for the stowing of supplies; and the other to be
equipped as a work room with work bench, forge, anvil, etc.</p>

<p>These rooms should be separate from the Boiler Room.</p>

<p><b>Entrances.</b> Should be provided on the front and sides of the
building for the public, and one in the rear for freight, etc.</p>

<p>A separate entrance should also be provided for the Staff.</p>

<p><b>Executive Offices.</b> This suite of offices consists of the following
rooms:—</p>

<ul>
<li>Trustees’ Room.</li>
<li>Committee Room.</li>
<li>Librarian’s Public Office.</li>
<li>Librarian’s Private Office.</li>
<li>Librarian’s Secretary’s Office.</li>
<li>Stenographers’ Room.</li>
<li>Assistant Librarian’s Office.</li>
<li>Supt. of Branches.<a id="FNanchor_401" href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a></li>
<li>Finance Department (Here or on top floor).</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_380"></a>[380]</span></p>

<p>The rooms in this group might be arranged similar to the offices
in large business houses with a central waiting room.</p>

<p>The Trustees’ Room and Committee Room should adjoin and be
connected with large folding doors. There should be an ante or
waiting room. Also lockers, hat boxes, etc. Toilet and Bath Room
should also be provided, as at Boston.</p>

<p>The Librarian’s Private Office should connect directly with the
Trustees’ and Committee Rooms.</p>

<p>The Librarian’s Public Office might also serve as a waiting room
for the Trustees’ and Assistant Librarian’s Offices.</p>

<p>The Librarian’s Room should be easily accessible to the public
and as near as many departments of the library as possible.</p>

<p><b>Exhibition Room, see Auditorium.</b></p>

<p>This room might be made by so arranging certain rooms, such
as the Art Book, Manuscripts, Music, Photographic Rooms, etc.,
that they could be converted into an exhibition room at any time.
(This is the better arrangement). Exhibitions of books, manuscripts,
prints, etc., would be held in this room.</p>

<p><b>Finance Department, see also Executive Offices.</b></p>

<p>This is intended for the offices of the Treasurer and his assistants.
Space should be provided for three or more clerks, with possibly a
small separate room for the Treasurer.</p>

<p>A vault should be located in this department for the storage of
documents, bills, etc.</p>

<p>This need not be a part of the Executive Offices, but may be
located on the top floor.</p>

<p><b>Fine Arts Room, see Art Book Room.</b></p>

<p><b>Fixed Furniture, see Furniture.</b></p>

<p><b>Floor Covering.</b> Rubber or cork carpet may be used, but these
should not be put over tiling.</p>

<p><b>Floors.</b> The kind of flooring for each room should be indicated
by the Architect. <i>Noiseless</i> floors should be placed in all public
rooms.</p>

<p><b>Floors, Height of.</b> Floors of the main building should coincide
with the level of the floors of the book stack, making the height
about 15 feet or two stacks floors high, or in that proportion.</p>

<p>Floors in the Stack Building should be 7½ feet between centers,
and should connect with the floors of the main building.</p>

<p><b>Foreign Book Collection.</b> The collection of books in foreign
languages for distribution among the branches would be located on
one of the floors of the Book Stack, preferably that nearest the
office of the Interchange Department. Provision should be made
for about 35,000 volumes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_381"></a>[381]</span></p>

<p><b>Furniture—Fixed and Movable.</b> Specifications for the furniture
required will be furnished later.</p>

<p><b>Garage.</b> A room of about 400 square feet should be provided
for the storage of library automobiles and equipped with machinery
to charge electric vehicles. If space permits, it might be advisable
to arrange a part of this room for the convenience of automobilists
who use the library.</p>

<p><b>Heads of Departments, see Superintendents of Departments.</b></p>

<p><b>Heating Plant.</b> As this plant cannot be located in a separate
building it should be as nearly isolated as possible. It should be so
constructed that there will be ample room for the handling of all
tools, especially while working at the boilers.</p>

<p><b>Height of Floor, see Floors, Height of.</b></p>

<p><b>Information Desk.</b> Space should be provided for an information
desk if possible near the main entrance, or near the Reference
and Delivery Departments, if they are quite near together.</p>

<p><b>Interchange Department.</b> This department, which has charge
of the interchange of books among the branches, should have an
office for superintendents and assistants near or connected with the
Traveling Libraries Department.</p>

<p>It should also be near or easily connected with the Official or
Public Catalog and the Book Stack.</p>

<p><b>Janitor’s Living Rooms.</b> It is desirable, if space permits,
that five or six living rooms similar in arrangement to a small apartment
be provided for the janitor so that he may be in the building
at all times.</p>

<p>These rooms should be located on the top floor.</p>

<p><b>Janitor’s Rooms.</b> A work room containing lockers, and closets
for the storage of necessary tools should be located in the basement
for the use of the janitor. An office for his use might also be
provided.</p>

<p>These rooms should be near the Stock and Store Rooms and the
Supply Department.</p>

<p><b>Lavatories, see Toilets.</b></p>

<p><b>Lecture Room, see Auditorium.</b></p>

<p><b>Librarian’s Office, see Executive Offices.</b></p>

<p><b>Librarian, Assistant, see Executive Offices.</b></p>

<p><b>Library for the Blind.</b> This is intended for the use of the
blind readers and their guides. Provision should be made both for
the delivery of books for home use, for reading in the library and
for “readings.” A small lecture room separated from the Delivery
Room should be provided for the latter purpose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_382"></a>[382]</span></p>

<p>The blind borrowers would be registered at this department rather
than at the General Registration Desk.</p>

<p>The best location for this department is on the ground floor,
although it may be placed on the top floor. It should be located
near a stack accommodating 15,000 volumes.</p>

<p>This is perhaps the one department of the library which might,
if necessary, be located at some branch, possibly Montague—instead
of in the Central Building without affecting seriously other departments.</p>

<p><b>Library of Congress Cards, see Cataloguing Department.</b></p>

<p><b>Lighting Plant.</b> Even if the library does not install its own
lighting plant, space should at least be provided for it in the sub-basement.</p>

<p>Wherever table lights are used as probably in the Reference and
Cataloguing Departments, they should be movable and so arranged
that they will not get in the way of readers’ feet.</p>

<p>So far as possible, general illumination is better than individual
lights.</p>

<p><b>Little Used Books, see Stack—Depository.</b></p>

<p><b>Lockers.</b> Clothing lockers, open and well ventilated, with
shelves for hats, should be abundantly provided.</p>

<p>Lockers for men and women should be located near the staff
entrance, and in addition, a few lockers should be provided in each
department.</p>

<p>The lockers should also be near the service elevator. The quarters
might be divided so to partially separate men, women, boys and
girls.</p>

<p><b>Lunch Room for Staff, see Staff Lunch Room.</b></p>

<p><b>Lunch room—Public, see Public Restaurant.</b></p>

<p><b>Magazine Room, see Periodical Reading Room.</b></p>

<p><b>Main Reading Room, see Reference Room.</b></p>

<p><b>Manuscript Department.</b> Room where valuable manuscripts
would be kept. It might be near Map or Art Book Room and
form one of the latter suite.</p>

<p><b>Map Room.</b> Provision should be made in this room for the convenient
handling of maps of various sizes and kinds.</p>

<p>This should be near the Reference Room for the sake of supervision.</p>

<p><b>Mechanical Service and Equipment, see Book Carriers,
Telephones, etc.</b></p>

<p><b>Music Room.</b> Provision should be made here or in a nearby
Stack for 15,000 bound volumes of books about music, and for the
musical scores which will be placed flat on shelves or in drawers.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_383"></a>[383]</span>
(It might form one of the suite with the Art Book Room, etc.) The
circulation of books from this department might be from the room
itself rather than from the Main Delivery Desk.</p>

<p>Adjoining should be a piano room with thick walls to deaden
sound.</p>

<p><b>Newspaper Reading Room.</b> If out-of-town newspapers are
supplied a larger room will be needed than as though only local
papers are taken. (It is a question whether it is best to supply
local papers at all). In any event the papers will be in newspaper
files on regular racks placed on the walls or separate stands. No
shelving (unless for local papers) need be provided here, but in an
adjoining room the back numbers will be made accessible.</p>

<p>This room should be on ground floor with separate outside
entrance if any papers are taken.</p>

<p>The bound volumes of newspapers take up much room and ample
space should be provided in adjoining Stack so that they might be
placed flat on roller shelves and provision made for 5,000 volumes
and growth for twenty-five years.</p>

<p><b>Open Shelves, see Delivery Department.</b></p>

<p><b>Order Department, see Book Order Department, see also
Supply Department.</b></p>

<p><b>Order and Receiving Room, see Book Order Department.</b></p>

<p><b>Packing Room.</b> Books are received here from the Cataloguing
Department and sent out to the Branches.</p>

<p>It should be on the ground floor near the Book Order and Supply
Departments and contain bins for at least forty branches, so that
when books and supplies are to be sent out they may be placed in
specific places preparatory to being shipped, and thus facilitate the
distribution of everything to branches.</p>

<p>The bins might be on rollers or tracks unless it is found better
to make them permanent and use ordinary trucks around the room.</p>

<p><b>Parcel Room, see Coat Room.</b></p>

<p><b>Patent Room.</b> All reports and specifications relating to American
and foreign patents belong in this room or adjoining Stack.</p>

<p>It should be near the Reference and Public Documents Rooms.</p>

<p>Provision should be made in the room itself for seventy-five or
one hundred readers, shelving for the most used volumes, and near
a stack to contain 20,000. Many of the specifications will be laid
flat. Boston seems large enough if sufficient stack space is provided.</p>

<p><b>Periodical Reading Room.</b> The current magazines will be
placed on tables and racks, and the bound volumes of periodicals
would be used in this room as well as in the Reference Room. It<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_384"></a>[384]</span>
should therefore be near stack with capacity of 50,000 volumes for
bound periodicals. The room should be connected with or under
the Reference Room, with stairs connecting.</p>

<p>If found best to locate this room elsewhere it may be placed
near newspaper room and made accessible from street.</p>

<p>A room adjoining would have shelves and cases for the unbound
back numbers as in Newark.</p>

<p><b>Photographic Room.</b> A place for taking pictures, consequently
a “dark room,” should adjoin.</p>

<p>It might be in attic or one of the Art Book suite, but in any event
should be connected with Art Book Room so that large books may
be easily conveyed by lift or otherwise from one to the other. Provision
should be made for the storage of photographs. It should
be well lighted as the walls may be used for the exhibition of pictures,
etc.</p>

<p>The “dark room” should have plenty of storage space for slides
and negatives.</p>

<p><b>Plot, see Site.</b></p>

<p><b>Pneumatic Tubes.</b> Most liberal provision should be made
for communicating between Delivery Rooms, Departments and
Stacks. (See also Book Carrier).</p>

<p><b>Printing Plant.</b> It is a question of policy whether a large or
small plant should be installed. If former, there will always be
trouble with labor unions, etc. Provision should at least be made
for a few small presses to do such necessary work as printing bulletins,
lists, catalog cards, etc.</p>

<p><b>Prints Room, see Art Book Room.</b></p>

<p><b>Public Catalog, see Catalog—Public.</b></p>

<p><b>Public Documents Room.</b> It is intended to provide for perhaps
fifty readers and have a near Stack accommodation for all
public documents, both national and state. This room might be
near the Patents Room and Reference Room.</p>

<p><b>Public Reception Room.</b> Part of Public Telephone and Public
Stenographer’s Room might adjoin an “Emergency Hospital,”
as suggested by Dr. Backus.</p>

<p><b>See also Writing and Copying Room, Public.</b></p>

<p><b>Public Restaurant.</b> If this could be provided for in connection
with staff lunch room it would be desirable so that all-day
students could obtain lunch.</p>

<p><b>Public Telephone, see Telephone, Public.</b></p>

<p><b>Public Toilet Rooms, see Toilet Rooms, Public.</b></p>

<p><b>Radiators.</b> These might be placed inside the walls <i>without
taking up room or shelving space</i>, but of course accessible by taking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_385"></a>[385]</span>
out division of shelving, or radiators might form a base 10 inches to
14 inches from floor under book cases—if not too hot.</p>

<p><b>Rare and Restricted Books Room.</b> Here would be kept the
precious books. It is essential that the vault run through this
section. Rare books and prints would be preserved and displayed
here.</p>

<p>It should possibly be part of Art Book suite.</p>

<p><b>Reading Rooms, see Reference Department and under
different headings, as Periodical Reading Room, Technical
and Scientific Periodical Room, etc.</b></p>

<p><b>Receiving Room, see Book Order Department; see also
Packing Room.</b></p>

<p><b>Reception Room, see Public Reception Room.</b></p>

<p><b>Reference Department.</b> This room will serve for general and
reference purposes, access being had to as many of the departments
and special collections as possible. For the sake of convenience
and supervision the special collections might be grouped around this
room.</p>

<p>It should be on the second floor, with large windows to about
4 feet of the floor. Seating capacity for from 450 to 600 readers
should be provided. It may be found easy to place this room on
the top floor with light from above, although such an arrangement
does not seem desirable. This will be the largest room in the
building.</p>

<p>The public catalog should be near by so that it might be used
and supervised by the Reference Librarian.</p>

<p>A delivery desk must also be provided on the same floor as the
Reference Department so that the serious student may have books
used by him in the Reference Department charged without being
obliged to go into the Delivery Department. This desk may be
located in the Reference Room, or it may be possible to locate it in
the Public Catalog Room so that the orders of those consulting
the Catalog may be sent directly to the Stack and the book be
delivered to the borrower in that room. If the Public Catalog
room is on the same floor as the Reference Room the books from
that department could be sent to the Delivery Desk in the Public
Catalog Room.</p>

<p>It is desirable to use the same Delivery Room for charging books
from both Reference and Delivery Departments.</p>

<p><b>Registration Room.</b> This is where the record of the individual
is kept. If on Brooklyn plan only a few cases will be necessary,
but if on Boston plan where there is a Central Registration more
space will be necessary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_386"></a>[386]</span></p>

<p>In any event it should be in or near the Delivery Department.</p>

<p><b>Repair Room.</b> This is where books are repaired by the staff.
It should be in the basement and near the bindery, and better
connect with it.</p>

<p><b>Repository for Little Used Books, see Stack Depository.</b></p>

<p><b>Restaurant, see Public Restaurant.</b></p>

<p><b>Restricted Books, see Rare and Restricted Books.</b></p>

<p><b>Roof.</b> Avoid skylights as much as possible, as the best of them
will leak.</p>

<p><b>Rubber, see Floor Covering.</b></p>

<p><b>Safes, see Vaults.</b></p>

<p><b>Scientific Periodical Room, see Technical and Scientific
Periodical Room.</b></p>

<p><b>Screens.</b> Window screens should be provided to exclude dust,
flies, mosquitoes, etc.</p>

<p><b>Service Stairs, see Stairs.</b></p>

<p><b>Shades.</b> Should be provided for all windows.</p>

<p><b>Shelving.</b> It seems best to leave the matter of shelving for the
different rooms until a conference can be had with the Architect
regarding the dimensions and location of the different rooms.</p>

<p><b>Site.</b> The site is a quadrilateral, measuring 69 feet 8 inches on
the Plaza, 332 feet on the Parkway, 486 feet 0 inches along the
Reservoir fence and 498 feet 4 inches along Flatbush avenue.</p>

<p><b>Special Collections, see Bell Collection, Manuscripts, Rare
Books, etc.</b></p>

<p><b>Special Study Rooms, see Study Rooms.</b></p>

<p><b>Stack.</b> Accommodations should be provided for 1,500,000 or
2,000,000, as suggested by Prof. A. D. F. Hamlin. Estimates may
be based on an allowance of eight volumes to the running foot,
except where reference books and art books are to be shelved, when
not more than six volumes should be allowed. It should be in the
rear of building if natural light is desired or in the <i>centre</i> if electric
light can be provided. In the latter case all of the outside space
could be utilized for rooms. Attention is called to the fact that
Boston, New York and the John Crerar Library, Chicago, have
found artificial light for stacks sufficient.</p>

<p>It goes without saying that this of all parts of the building should
be fireproof, with emergency fireproof doors between this and the
main building.</p>

<p>Each stack story will be 7 feet to 7½ wide, in the clear, the architect
to name, when submitting the plans, the particular stack to
be used. No stack should be more than 7 feet high, 9 or 12 feet
long; 8 inches deep, if single, or 16 inches deep if double, back to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_387"></a>[387]</span>
back; 12 inches if reference. The aisles should be 3 feet wide,
with side aisles 3 to 4 feet wide along the walls.</p>

<p>Provision should be made for the maximum capacity indicated
and the Architect should show how the stack could be extended to
serve for double the capacity.</p>

<p>Under shelving will be indicated the <i>wall capacity</i> desired.</p>

<p><b>Stack—Depository.</b> When opportunity offers, purchases of
books are made from second-hand dealers and others even if not
needed at the time. A stock in trade is thus formed and orders
received from Branches are filled here whenever possible. These
books may be stored in the Stack near the Book Order Department,
and accommodation should be provided for 35,000 volumes.</p>

<p>Books seldom called for or little used should also be housed in
the Depository Stack. Space should be provided for 30,000 volumes.</p>

<p>The Depository Stack might be placed underneath the street
level as has been done in Vienna. At least three stack floors could
thus be obtained.</p>

<p><b>Staff Rooms.</b> Under this head should be included all rooms,
other than work rooms, used by the Staff. It is likely that 150-250
employees will have places in the Central Building, and it is
essential that adequate provision should be made for male and
female adult employees, messengers, (boys and girls) janitors,
cleaners, etc.</p>

<p>A separate entrance should be provided for the staff and lockers
for their use as indicated under that heading.</p>

<p>The following rooms should be provided, Staff Lunch and Sitting
Rooms, with butler’s pantry and kitchen, and a special room for
meetings of the Staff. These may be located in a mezzanine floor
or be placed in the basement or top floor. They should, however,
be so situated as to be easily accessible from as many departments
as possible so that assistants will not waste time in going to and
fro. Private stairs may be provided as in the Newark Public
Library.</p>

<p><b>Staff Lunch Room.</b> If possible the Lunch Room should be
divided so that the Superintendents of Departments could lunch
together without interfering with the scheduled hours of the balance
of the Staff.</p>

<p>Such an arrangement would make it possible for the Superintendents
of Departments to discuss library problems while at lunch.</p>

<p>If two Lunch Rooms are provided a large butler’s pantry should
adjoin each room. These would contain cupboards, closets, sinks,
refrigerators, gas stoves, china closets, etc., so arranged that each
assistant could have her own things.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_388"></a>[388]</span></p>

<p>If a Public Restaurant is planned, the kitchen of that might
be connected with the Staff Rooms so that the Staff as well as the
public might be served from it.</p>

<p><b>Staff Meeting Room.</b> Here the members of the whole staff
would meet once a month for the regular business meetings, and
possibly oftener, to talk over matters pertaining to the interests of
the institution. The attendance might be from 100 to 200.</p>

<p>Possibly these meetings could be held in the Apprentice Class
Room. If a separate room is provided it should be in combination
with the other Staff rooms.</p>

<p><b>Staff Sitting Room.</b> A comfortable place for the assistants to
rest in after lunch should adjoin the Lunch Rooms. The Sitting
and Lunch Rooms should be so connected that the three could be
thrown into one.</p>

<p>The Sitting Room would also be used in cases of temporary illness,
and should have couches and ordinary medical appliances.</p>

<p><b>Stairs.</b> None should be circular. This point cannot be too
emphatically indicated.</p>

<p>So far as possible all stairs should be <i>inside</i> the building.</p>

<p>Easy risers—possibly not more than 4 inches are desirable.</p>

<p>Separate stairs should be provided for Staff, and when possible
the different departments should be connected by private stairway,
this to insure easy and quick communication between different
floors and departments.</p>

<p><b>Standard Library.</b> This consists of a collection of the best books
as introduced by Mr. Foster of the Providence Public Library. It
would contain books in best editions which would be recommended
for purchase by private buyers. It could be placed in one of the
study rooms or better in Reference or Delivery Room, but it should
be capable of supervision.</p>

<p><b>Statistical Department.</b> This forms one of the Special Reference
Rooms where books on statistics, economics, etc., would be
shelved.</p>

<p><b>Stenographer’s Room, Public.</b> For the use of those who wish
to dictate letters or addresses.</p>

<p>It might be near the Public Telephone or Writing and Copying
Room.</p>

<p><b>Stenographers’ Room (Official), see Executive Offices.</b></p>

<p><b>Stock Room (Books), see Stack, Depository.</b></p>

<p><b>Stock Room (supplies).</b> The ordinary Branch supplies such
as printing, stationery, brooms, soap, etc., are bought in quantities
and stored at the library. Branch “wants” are thus quickly
and cheaply supplied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_389"></a>[389]</span></p>

<p>It could be under or near the Supply Department (which see).</p>

<p>Closets, cupboards and shelving in plenty, with special arrangement
as to “bins” provided.</p>

<p><b>Storeroom (supplies).</b> This is intended for brooms, pails, etc.,
used by janitor about the Central Building. It is not the same as
the Stock Room where supplies for the whole system are kept,
but may be near it. Several closets for such purpose should also
be placed on each floor.</p>

<p><b>Storeroom for Little Used Books, see Stack, Depository.</b></p>

<p><b>Study Rooms.</b> These are for classes or individuals studying
particular subjects, and who need quiet and seclusion. Sometimes
it will be used by literary societies like a Browning Club, Shakespeare
Club, etc.</p>

<p>They should be adjacent to and form a part of the Reference
Room. Although only three or four are mentioned more can be
used, and they might be larger or smaller than dimensions given.</p>

<p><b>Superintendents of Departments.</b> They are Superintendent
of Cataloguing Department, Superintendent of Children’s Work
Superintendent of Book Orders, Superintendent of Supplies.</p>

<p>The Architect suggests that these might be grouped as in a business
house, with central waiting space and with access to each
other. Perhaps a better plan would be to have the office of each
Superintendent near his own department.</p>

<p>The office of the Superintendent of Branches would be connected
with the Executive suite.</p>

<p><b>Supply Room, see Stock Room (supplies).</b></p>

<p><b>Supply Department.</b> The Superintendent of this Department
makes the purchases for all the branches and must therefore meet
buyers as well as Branch Librarians. There should be an outer and
inner office. A store room should be provided on this floor for the
storage of stationery, etc. This department should have outside
entrance so that teams could deliver goods direct.</p>

<p><b>Technical and Scientific Periodical Room.</b> Will contain
current scientific periodicals and should have bound volumes (20,000)
of same on shelves in room or in stack nearby.</p>

<p>It might be near Reference Department or the Periodical Reading
Room.</p>

<p><b>Telephones, Official.</b> Long distance telephone, with switch
board should be installed also a complete system connecting all
departments.</p>

<p><b>Telephone, Public.</b> Booths for the use of the public should also
be provided.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_390"></a>[390]</span></p>

<p>The switch board for both the public and official telephones may
be the same and this may be located in the Public Reception and
Telephone Room on the ground floor, or the switch board of the
Official Telephone may be located in the Repair Room.</p>

<p><b>Toilets.</b> Ample provision should be made for public and private
toilets for both sexes, but the public toilets should be at a distance
from any outside public entrance. Private toilets should be on
each floor, and for Trustees and Librarian. An attendant will be
needed in each public toilet room.</p>

<p><b>Traveling Libraries Department.</b> Cases of books are sent
from here to schools, shops, societies, clubs, etc. An office for the
Superintendent of this department and his assistants should be
located near the Interchange and Foreign Book Departments.
Stack accommodations for 50,000 volumes should adjoin the office.
It should also be near the freight elevator.</p>

<p><b>Treasurer’s Office Department.</b> Space should be provided
for Treasurer who is a member of the Board of Trustees.</p>

<p><b>Unpacking Room, see Book Order Department, also Supply
Dept.</b></p>

<p><b>Vacuum Cleaning Apparatus.</b> The building should be
equipped with the best cleaning system.</p>

<p><b>Vaults.</b> Various records such as those of the Board, Librarian,
Accession Books of Cataloguing Department, expensive and rare
books and manuscripts would be kept in the vaults.</p>

<p>They should be at least 8 × 10 feet in the clear and extend from
the basement to the top with openings on each floor into such
rooms, if possible, as Trustees’, Librarian’s, Cataloguing, Art Book,
etc.</p>

<p><b>Ventilation, see also Heating.</b></p>

<p>The most perfect system of ventilation should be introduced
and ought to be both direct and indirect. Particular attention
should be paid to the Reference Department, Delivery Department,
Children’s Room, Periodical and Newspaper Reading Rooms
and Stack. As it cannot be in a separate building it, as well as the
Heating Plant, should be in sub-basement.</p>

<p><b>Water Supply.</b> If there is likely to be trouble from low pressure
an engine should pump water into a tank placed on the roof.
Hot and cold water for cleaning should be liberally supplied on each
floor for janitor service and for staff.</p>

<p><b>Windows.</b> In the Stack they should start from the ceiling and
go to the floor and be placed opposite every aisle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_391"></a>[391]</span></p>

<p>In the main rooms they need not come within 5 feet of the floor
unless an exception is made in the Trustees’, Librarian’s, Reference
and Periodical Reading Rooms, and Study Rooms.</p>

<p>In the Cataloguing Department they should begin 4 feet from
floor and extend to ceiling.</p>

<p><b>Work Room, see Repair Room.</b></p>

<p><b>Writing and Copying Room (public).</b> This is a place where
readers may use ink and copy from books, or do general writing.</p>

<p>It may be near Stenographers’ room or Reference Department,
although the latter seems to be the best placed.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Epilogue</h2>

<p>The outline sketched in this volume should
suggest, even to skimmers,—</p>

<p>That the business of planning a library is
specific, technical and minute;—</p>

<p>That it is like the planning of other useful
structures which can be spoiled by blunders of
ignorance, or by sins done in the name of art;—</p>

<p>That it is folly to leave such serious work to
tyros or dabblers,—even to architects who are
amateur librarians;—</p>

<p>That a committee can direct, an architect
can construct, but only a wise and mature
librarian can plan a library where the staff can
work, and where the readers can see, think and
breathe.</p>

even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
